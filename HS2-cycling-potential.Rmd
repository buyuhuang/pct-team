# Introduction

The original plan for this analysis was to assess the cycling potential along the HS2 route.
The new plan, based on feedback from the DfT about what would be most useful, is to assess the cycling potential along the *cycle path network* designed by consultants to be constructed in tandem with construction of the HS2 route.

An overview of this plan is presented below, alongside some summary statistics of the proposed route.
