# Abstract {-}

The impacts of major infrastrucuture pojects on many aspects of life are well established. However, the impacts on other modes of travel, particularly walking and cycling, have been under-explored. The paper sets out to fill this research gap, using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The method is developed in theoretical terms, focussing on risks of 'severance' and opportunities associated with active travel 'desire lines' that run parallel to proposed routes. Then it is applied to a large scale case study: the planned construction of a high-speed rail network on the UK (HS2). This empirical case study demonstrates that the method is scalable yet able to identify risks and opportunites at local levels, down to road segments, which could guide pro-cycling interventions associated with construction or provide a source of evidence to re-assess the overall impacts of major infrastructure projects.

# Application: the impacts of high speed rail on cycling in the UK

To assess the potential benefits of new crossings for cycling uptake during and after construction of HS2, the method was applied to geographical data about the route and current travel patterns surrounding it. The first stage was to identify all commutes that could potentially be directly affected by the HS2 infrastructure, by selecting all commuter desire lines that pass anywhere within a 20 km buffer. This is illustrated in Figure xx.

```{r}
hs2 = readRDS("input-data/hs2.Rds")
l = readRDS("input-data/l_mini.Rds")
proj4string(hs2) = proj4string(l)
hs2_buf20 = stplanr::buff_geo(hs2, 20000)
# l = readRDS("../pct-bigdata/pct_lines_oneway_shapes.Rds")
l_sev = l[hs2,]
l_sam = l[sample(nrow(l), 1000),] # work with sample (comment for all)
# osm_tiles = read_osm(bb(hs2, ext = 1.2))
# saveRDS(osm_tiles, "input-data/osm_tiles_hs2.Rds")
l_buf = l[hs2_buf20,]
osm_tiles = readRDS("input-data/osm_tiles_hs2.Rds")
qtm(osm_tiles) +
  qtm(l_buf, line.col = "blue") +
  qtm(hs2, line.col = "black", line.lwd = 3) +
  tm_shape(hs2_buf20) +
  tm_borders(lwd = 4)
# select lines that cross the route

```

## Cycling potential across the the HS2 route

### Opportunities to reduce severance


```{r, fig.cap="Overview of the proposed HS2 route, overlaid with a sample of commute desire lines (grey) and all desire lines that cross the proposed route."}

osm_tiles = readRDS("input-data/osm_tiles_hs2.Rds")
qtm(osm_tiles) +
  qtm(hs2, line.col = "black", line.lwd = 3) +
  qtm(l_sam, line.col = "blue") +
  qtm(l_sev)
# select lines that cross the route
```

## Cycling potential parallel to the HS2 route

### Opportunities for cycle paths along the HS2 route

Ideas:
<!-- Use a regression mode of distance to transport infrastructure to estimate deterrant of motorways - and therefore how it could be mitigated. Outliers with high cycling relative to road proximity could show how to mitigat negative impact. -->
