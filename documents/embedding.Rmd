# Abstract {-}

Cycling is an effective means of transport for millions of people and has great potential to be much more extensively used in most countries. Despite strategies to promote cycling, funding has generally remained limited and planning for cycling remains a marginal activity for most transport planning authorities. An historical review of transport planning is presented which explores the marginalisation on cycling. In order to properly formulate the transport planning problem which includes cycling as a solution, we argue that structural change is required within transport planning authorities. We also argue that enhanced data collection for cycling as a mode is required. A set of well formulated objectives which are measurable with available data may then be used in open source modelling, which provides a powerful tool for objective decision making. We conclude that these developments will help cycling become central to the discipline of transport planning.

It is widely accepted that transport systems in the majority of settlements across the world are not conducive to environmental sustainability or human health. Much has been written about this problem [e.g. @rouse_energy:_1975;@peake_transport_1994;@han_assessment_2008;@de_nazelle_improving_2011]. Many grand remedies have been proposed [e.g. @wang_strategic_2013;@raux_transport_2010;@cuenot_prospect_2012], but such high-level recommendations have seldom been implemented in practice.

Perhaps part of the reason that the recommendations emanating from research findings are not implemented by policy-makers is that they tend to be abstract and seemingly directed towards world leaders. Yet professionals, such as transport planners, influence decisions at the local level and are often the people most instrumental in shaping local visions, programmes and projects. Furthermore, the remedies suggested in the in the papers referenced above risk being seen as too general and conceptual to be easily translated into practice.

Much has been written about how to make transport systems overall more sustainable, and the topic has become a prominent concern in the transport literature [@schwanen_scientific_2011;@banister_sustainable_2008]. Still, such broad academic advocacy has been slow to filter into real-world transport plans. This paper is deliberately more directed and is centred on cycling. Concentrating attention in this way allows more realistic and actionable guidance for transport planners and academics actively engaging with the planning process.

<!-- This approach is designed to complement, rather than replace, the strategic  and conceptual advice contained in other papers. Transport planning is a practical discipline, so the paper deliberately focusses on factors over which transport planners and engineers have some control. It does not, for example, deal explicitly with the state of the economy or national political priorities, which undoubtedly affect mode choice, but over which planners have little control. -->

<!-- The premise of this paper is the perceived disconnect between the discipline of transport planning and transport policies.

But why focus on cycling? In the transport planning literature there has been much written about sustainability but less focus on cycling (and also walking), despite strong evidence on the ability of this mode to deliver both health and environmental benefits *simultaneously*, and at low cost. This unique mix of 'co-benefits' from cycling is something that 'technological fixes' do not provide, and technological fixes are harder to justify in an age of austerity and hard-pressed resources. Electric cars, for example, are in fact coal-fired cars when driven in the majority of countries where this most polluting of energy sources has yet to be phased out [@van_vliet_energy_2011]. Further, electric cars cannot deliver the health benefits of cycling. Bus rapid transit schemes, to provide another example, can encourage walking [@lemoine_transmilenio_2016] but can be costly [@wirasinghe_bus_2013].

There has been much written about encouraging cycling but little focussed explicitly on the mode's interaction with the process of transport planning. @pucher_making_2008 use evidence from The
Netherlands, Denmark and Germany to illustrate the kinds of policies that make cycling 'irresistible'. Central government buy-in was found to be important, and this was in addition to more subtle factors such as: investment in and management of cycle parking facilities; good integration with public transport; cycle training for all children and extensive training of car drivers; *strict liability* (a legal device which uses a hierarchy of assumed responsibility whereby the larger and more dangerous vehicle is assumed to be responsible for road traffic casualties unless proven otherwise); and a range of measures to discourage car dependency in urban areas.

Cycling uptake has been much studied from psychological and sociological perspecives. @pooley_policies_2013, for example, found that the widespread perception of cycling as a dangerous and unusual mode of transport discouraged its wider uptake in several English towns. The resulting recommendations coincided coincided with those of @pucher_making_2008 and include: a safe physical environment; legislating for motorists' consideration for active modes; and land use policies to encourage more local economic activity [@pooley_policies_2013].
@geus_psychosocial_2008, to take another example, explored a range of factors affecting cycling uptake. Supporting @pooley_policies_2013, the study suggested that a combination of high-quality infrastructure and a supportive social and policy framework was effective in encouraging the uptake of cycling. Of relevance to transport planners, @geus_psychosocial_2008 found that proximity to parks and other green spaces was associated with more cycling, suggesting that directing cycle paths through parks and off busy roads could make cycling more attractive, particularly for people for whom perceived danger and self-esteem is a barrier. This hypothesis has been supported by a natural experiment of an off-road cycle path [@heinen_changes_2015].

@buehler_bikeway_2016 categorised cycle infrastructure interventions by scale, focussing on *links* (e.g. cycle paths), *nodes* (e.g. road junctions) and entire cycle *networks*. Their review strongly suggests taht infrastructure can boost cycling levels. However, evidence on the relative importance of different types of intervention, particularly in relation to node, network and non-infrastructural interventions, was limited. From a planning perspective, @buehler_bikeway_2016 recommend that practitioners should seek to provide for cycling by planning and implementing facilities at the scale of the network rather than individual links and nodes. This accords with the view that a transport system can only be effective when it is a coherent network @gallagher_planning_2014. 

Section 2 discusses the marginalisation of cycling in transport planning in more detail. Section 3 goes on to outline ways of embedding planning for cycling more fully in the local transport planning process including a discussion of appropriate institutional structures, the need for data, and importantly the way the data is used in transport models. We draw conclusions in Section 4.

<!-- It can be seen therefore that there are reasons linked to co-benefits to focus on cycling as a key part of a wider sustainable transport strategy. While there is some growing recognition of a need to plan better for cycling, little work has focused on how planning for cycling should be thoroughly embedded in the transport planning process. Evidence from mode choice studies suggests that a range of barriers block cycling uptake in many contexts. These barriers operate at many levels, from national transport priorities down to personal self-esteem. These can, in turn, be influenced by transport infrastructure. The framing of cycle planning in terms of the creation of seamless networks is required in order maximise the chances of creating the most optimal system. This is a different approach than homing in on single interventions to solve particular problems (e.g. provision of cycle paths or advertising the benefits of cycling). -->

<!-- The logical next question is: how can transport planning practitioners and transport engineers achieve seamless networks for cycle traffic? At a more pragmatic level, the question may be re-framed as how can the prioritised elimination of the most damaging barriers to cycling in local and regional transport plans be achieved? -->
<!-- The rest of this paper examines and provides these questions. -->

# The marginalisation of cycling in transport planning

Transport modelling is an important part of transport planning. In their comprehensive history of transport modelling, @boyce_forecasting_2015 demonstrate that the field emerged in a very specific context: the explosive growth of suburbia and car dependency in the USA. Although the policy objectives of transport planning have progressed substantially beyond the accommodation of growth in car use, this historical legacy still exerts an enormous influence over the field. Transport modelling, which plays an important role in deciding how funding is allocated, was never designed for cycling, and this issue persists today.

There is little doubt that the intentions of the early modellers were admirable and that it was an exciting time: "urban travel forecasting was definitely 'where the action was' for young transportation engineers and planners entering the field in the 1960s" [@boyce_forecasting_2015, p. 67]. In hindsight, however, it seems the resulting models facilitated a 'predict (demand) and provide (infrastructure)' paradigm leading to car dependency and associated negative externalities: pollution, road traffic casualties and transport inequality. Would it have been impossible for early models to create alternative future scenarios where cycling, and active travel more generally, played a central role in transport plans? @boyce_forecasting_2015 do not discuss this, although it is clear that warnings from dissenting voices in academic research were not heeded. @fels_comparative_1975, for example, envisioned future transport "policy evaluations related to energy utilization", in which cycling was prioritised over driving, as the former was found to be far more efficient than the latter, consuming 0.1 kWh/mile rather than 1 or more kWh/mile. 

During the conditions of economic growth and increased car economic ownership, which prevailed throughout most of the post Second World War period, facilitating expansion of motor traffic was the primary objective in most transport planning institutions. The political reasons for this prioritisation of the motor car  were simple: the car was a symbol of modernity, wealth and economic growth. Active modes were viewed as outdated, suitable for the poor and eccentric while the rest of society shifted to the luxury of cars. In this context cycling was not merely marginalised from transport planning: it was almost completely absent.

An interesting example of the historical marginalisation of cycling in mainstream transport planning comes from the 1970s USA, which coincided with oil price shocks and societal questions around energy use [e.g. @illich_energy_1974]. It is instructive that the only major study on cycling during this period conducted by the US government was not from the Department of Transport, but the Environmental Protection Agency [@dougherty_bicycle_1974]. This 72 page report, Bicycle Transportation, was motivated by the "unprecedented boom" in bicycle sales during the early 1970s and goes on to outline, in great detail, the social, health and environment benefits of the mode. The report also comments on the marginalisation of the mode from mainstream planning, noting that "Government has general viewed the bicycle as a recreational vehicle" [@dougherty_bicycle_1974, p. 2].

When the oil price stabilised growth in car use accelerated again in the USA and this trend was followed in most nations across the world. Despite noting the economic benefits for cycling infrastructure, with segregated cycle paths costing roughly 50 times less per metre than highways ($20,000 vs $1 million per mile), @dougherty_bicycle_1974 were unsuccessful in persuading the US Government to invest heavily in cycling. 

Instead, transport planners focussed on the car. Cycling was generally seen as a form of recreation rather than transport and, as such, did not deserve dedicated space on the travel network. Cycle infrastructure, in the few places where there was any at all, tended to be placed in ad-hoc places to minimise costs. In the minority of plans where cycling was accounted for, the acronym SLOAP (space left over after planning) encapsulates the approach adopted for cycle planning. This approach has prevailed in most places in most countries ever since.

As @pucher_making_2008 point out, there were a few exceptions to this rule. In the Netherlands in particular, there was a concerted effort during the 1970s to ensure that cycling *was* promoted as a legitimate, efficient, effective and beneficial  mode of transport. The history of transport planning in the Netherlands shows that it was an overtly political movement, in opposition to the dominance of the motor car, that created the conditions in which cycling infrastructure could be properly designed and funded.

It is interesting to note that, far from always being a cycling paradise, the Netherlands experienced dramatic *declines* in cycling during the 1960s and 1970s, following the motorisation of urban transport in other cities. Cycle use roughly halved between 1960 and 1980, falling from around 1400 km to around 700 km per person per year. This shows that even in the Netherlands, cycling was becoming marginalised by the motor car and it took vociferous public campaigns to change the tide: "Outrage at the scale of road deaths, especially of children, the oil crisis of 1973, and a general sense that enough had been conceded to the motor car, were factors bringing about a change in public attitudes" [@wardlaw_history_2014]. Central government funding followed, allowing the total distance of cycle paths in the Netherlands to increase from around 9,000 km to 16,000 km between the late 1970s (when the reinvestment in cycling began) and 1988. 

One could argue that even in the Netherlands, cycling is still marginalised by the car. Despite high levels of cycling, the Netherlands is a car dependent country and the distance travelled by car each year by far outweighs the number of passenger kilometres of travel taking place by bicycle. Even on high-quality Dutch infrastructure conflict arises, e.g. between cycle and moped users [@boztas_dutch_2015]. Furthermore, partly as a consequence of the quality and extent of cycle networks in the Netherlands, cycling on the roads is uncommon and often not permitted. Therefore, despite impressive investments in and uptake of cycling in the Netherlands, the country still has a long way to go before active modes are dominant.

@banister_sustainable_2008 discussed transport paradigms in detail and suggested that the current transport planning paradigm was not conducive to delivering sustainable policies. To remedy this situation a series of reforms were suggested. These were primarily conceptual and high-level in character but include some actionable guidance for transport planners, including the importance of public engagement in the planning process, and the need to build-in adaptability into transport planning, which has historically been a top-down process. These themes are returned to in the next section, which builds on the history of transport planning as it relates to the marginalisation of cycling, by using it to identify specific opportunities in the practice of transport planning for cycling become central to transport plans.

# Opportunities for embedding cycling in the planning process

Transport planning is not a linear process. It is iterative. The insights gleaned from plans that have been implemented should feed back into subsequent plans in a cyclical process [@ortuzar_modelling_2001]. The transport planning cycle does have an order, however, as illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:stages). The six stages build on the eight stages described by @ortuzar_modelling_2001, with the four stages they use to describe modelling (construction, generation, forecasting and testing) merged into one, and with the addition of public engagement, which reflects the shift to more participatory methods [@banister_sustainable_2008].

The remainder of this section is constructed as a discussion of each stage in the process and the ways in which considerations relating to cycling  should be embedded. Note that public engagement is discussed last not because it is the final stage but because it relates to all the other stages.

```{r stages, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Stages of the transport planning process."}
knitr::include_graphics(c("../figures/stages.png"))
```

This section was also influenced by @gallagher_planning_2014, who provide guidelines on planning for cycling. Their guidelines begin with the observation that cycling was a major mode of transport in the UK but has been 'neglected' by practitioners since the proliferation of cars in the 1950s. It proceeds to outline opportunities for embedding cycling in the following areas of transport planning practice: the regulatory context in which transport planning operates; strategic transport plans; the design of new transport networks and routes and the promotion of behavioural change
(see [ciht.org.uk](http://www.ciht.org.uk/en/media-centre/news/index.cfm/ciht-launches-new-planning-for-cycling-guidelines) for an open access version of the report). The guidelines in @gallagher_planning_2014 are not repeated here. Instead, the section extends and generalises their recommendations that relate to the wider planning process, rather than those related to cycling interventions specifically.

Transport planning does not take place in a vacuum. It takes place within a dynamic and often politicised institutional context. This is tacitly acknowledged by @ortuzar_modelling_2001, who regard it as part of the "formulation of the problem" at the beginning of their eight stages. But how does the formulation occur? 
@ciht_guidelines_1996 suggests that this stage requires politicians, planners and stakeholders to state a vision for an area, and define the urban and the transport objectives that need to be achieved. This statement will then feed into initial ideas and concepts for the development of transport solutions. 
The 'framing' of the problem is thus strongly influenced by institutional structures and decision making processes and should be considered at the outset of cycling plans.

## Institutional structures

A common problem faced by planners designing for active modes is that transport planning institutions were generally set-up at a time when 'transport planning' was virtually synonymous with 'highway planning'. As outlined in the previous section, cycling and walking were barely considered to be legitimate transport modes at all. Although this is changing, the structure of transport planning organisations has generally not also changed, as government institutions are subject to a high degree of inertia. Figure \@ref(fig:organo) illustrates the point, with a case study of the UK's Department for Transport (DfT). The DfT staff member responsible for cycling is the 'Deputy Director Sustainable Travel and Equalities'. It is interesting to note that their brief also includes oversight of the multi-modal Local Sustainable Transport Fund (LSTF) and its successors, disabilities and equalities agendas, hence the lack of the words 'walking' or 'cycling' in their job description. Despite the breadth of this brief, the 'organogram' depicted in Figure \@ref(fig:organo) shows that the post is a long way down the DfT's managerial hierarchy and the post-holder reports to three other people (the Director of Local Transport, Director General: Roads Traffic and Local, and Director General, Roads, Local and Traffic). Contrasting the lack of mention of 'walk' or 'cycle' against the car-orientated term 'roads' (which is mentioned five times in Figure \@ref(fig:organo) and at every level of the DfT's structure) demonstrates the extent to which motorised modes are embedded in the DfT's institutional structure. This suggests that a pre-cursor to any serious consideration of cycling is an organisational restructuring to embed this mode in such a way that their beneficial efficiency and effectiveness is given due weight. 

```{r organo, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="The organisational structure of the UK's Department for Transport. See http://reference.data.gov.uk/gov-structure/organogram/ for further information."}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/dft-organo-web.png")
```

The DfT provides a clear example of opportunities for embedding cycling in transport planning via institutional restructuring, but the issue is by no means isolated to the national level in the UK. The same issues can be found at the local authority level across the UK, where the highway and traffic engineering functions of local and regional councils tend to be more prominent in institutional hierarchies, and receive more funding, than functions responsible for cycling. Moreover, the same problem is international. None of the eleven Directors of the US Department of Transport, for example, are responsible for cycling. On the other hand security, crisis management and business feature prominently (see
[www.transportation.gov](https://www.transportation.gov/mission/administrations/intelligence-security-emergency-response/operations-division)).
Similarly, motorised transport infrastructure such as highways and high-speed rail feature prominently in China's Ministry of Transport, while cycling (and walking) is absent from the ministry's website (see [www.mot.gov.cn/](http://www.mot.gov.cn/)). Even the Dutch Directorate for Mobility and Transport (which sits within the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment) has a structure that is biased towards high energy transport: four of its six sub-directorate job titles explicitly mention motorised modes (Roads and Safety, Public Transportation and Rail, Maritime Affairs and Civil Aviation) and none is tasked with further embedding cycling (see [www.government.nl/ministries/](https://www.government.nl/ministries/ministry-of-infrastructure-and-the-environment/documents/leaflets/2015/01/21/organisation-structure-ministry-of-infrastructure-and-the-environment)).

Although they are close to the root of the problem, institutional structures generally take many years to change [@beddoe_overcoming_2009].  It therefore makes sense to find ways for cycling to be taken more seriously within existing structures. An example of this, also taken from the UK context, is Highways England, a government-owned company with responsibility for managing the core road network. Despite its remit being predominantly related to motor traffic "improve England’s motorways and major A roads", it has recently adopted a Cycling Strategy which is publicly available from its [website](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/490545/S150572_Cycling_Strategy.pdf). This strategy identified areas of overlap between roads investment and maintenance, and cycling, and aims to highlight the potential of Highways England to "provide integrated schemes which improve cycling facilities." Given that the budget of Highways England far exceeds that allocated for cycling specifically, this cycling strategy relating to the core road network presents an opportunity for embedding cycling within transport planning thinking even within an organisation whose structure and focus is dominated by provision for motor traffic. Given that most countries now have agencies, in one form or another, that operate at various levels of aggregation for planning and managing substantial parts of the road network, this approach to embedding cycling could potentially scale internationally.

## Formulation of the problem

While insitutional hierarchies are certainly outside the scope of most transport planners, one would expect them to decide what the *purpose* of their work is on a case-by-case basis. However, transport plans have historically start with the (frequently unstated) objective of enabling the growth in car use, without increasing congestion [@boyce_forecasting_2015]. This formulation of the problem seems to have continued into the present day, with 'path dependency' ensuring that were originally given provision for cars will demand further provision in the future, to the detriment of cycling [@hensley_healthy_2014]. The nature and extent of road networks, for example, are highly prescripted based on the needs of car users. Their shape at a macro level, and the detail at a micro level is determined by the speed of the traffic. The use of the system is based on riding or driving 'on-sight' with rules about priority. Sometimes there may be direct control such as through signal controlled junctions. The system works adequately well if the nature of the network, the characteristics of the vehicle and the road user behaviour are well aligned [@parkin_planning_2010].

Inputs into the process include the location of origin of that demand and the location of the desired destination of that demand and an analysis of the route choices which are usually based on a balance of time and distance. It is hard to embed cycling into such a large-scale process as transport modelling modelling software which frame the problem quantitatively often include nothing of the comfort and attractiveness of a route from a cycling perspective. The problem for planning, modelling and designing cycle networks is therefore not just a 'technical' problem of demand allocation based on the minimization of functions of measurable time and cost, but a multi-dimensional problem that includes wider urban design issues which are not as prescribable as design parameters based on design speed.

## Data collection

Applied to transport, the saying "measure what you value" suggests that the modes of transport of the greatest interest should be monitored most closely. By this measure, cycling is marginalised in most transport contexts: the majority of automated transport data collection devices installed around the world measure motorised traffic. The scale of this problem from a US perspective was outlined as follows [@lindsey_minnesota_2013]:

"[Transport authorities] have established sophisticated, comprehensive monitoring systems to produce estimates of vehicular traffic on federal, state, and local roads. However, comparable systems for monitoring non-motorized traffic ---
bicyclists and pedestrians ---
have not been established, and transportation planners and engineers generally lack basic information about bicycle and pedestrian traffic volumes needed to plan for these modes."

This lack of quantitative data is a major barrier preventing transport planners from demonstrating the imporance of active modes. Conversely, the benefits of measuring cycling behaviour range from the technical to the political. The technical benefit is that detailed information about the contexts in which people *do not* cycle can provide evidence about what local barriers are, allowing planners to target their interventions more effectively. Politically, cycling helps prevent the marginalisation of the mode *within* the transport planning organisation: technical staff will be needed to analyse the resulting data and this will help ensure that the mode is treated seriously. Further, data on cycling behaviour can be used to raise the profile of cycling in the public consciousness.

There are many ways to measure cycling. The most basic measure is the simple 'traffic count', a point data collection device that records the presence of a particular vehicle (or pedestrian) on the network at a particular time. As detailed by @lindsey_minnesota_2013, such count data can help allocate resources to and assess the effectiveness of interventions aiming to increase the number of cycling trips. The main methods for counting cyclists outlined by @lindsey_minnesota_2013 were manual field counts, infra-red monitors, magnetic loop detectors, piezometric and pneumatic movement sensors and video imaging.

More sophisticated than link counts, which may also be used to estimate total vehicle kilometrage, are junction counts which provide information on turns being made at a junction. Beyond this, we may be interested in patterns of movement across a network and these may be gleaned from surveys in the field, but these would require some form of identification on the vehicle being used, such as number plate recognition. More often than not, patterns of movement would be derived from household based transport related surveys.

More general surveys can sometimes be modified to include specific questions. One example a question commuter mode choice in. The UK and many other governments also conduct transport specific surveys. These will usually ask about transport choices for a range of journey purposes. Transport surveys asking more detailed questions about cycling (e.g. 'what are the main barriers preventing you from cycling?') may be conducted as part of specific local transport planning exercises. If constructed in appropriate ways, such surveys may provide sufficiently robust parameters for mode and route choice modelling. Increasingly, there are 'Big Data' sources such as GPS data provided by smartphone 'apps' and origin-destination matrices derived from mobile telephones connecting to cellphone towers that are being used for transport modelling purposes.

Here is not the place to discuss the relative merits of each option --- see @lindsey_minnesota_2013 for that. It suffices to say that there is a wide range of options for measuring cyclists and, provided that transport planners have the resources to make sense of such data, this can help to embed cycling in the heart of the transport planning process, which prides itself on being an evidence-based discipline. With the rapid uptake of personal activity monitoring by athletes and enthusiasts, new datasets provide a potentially low cost opportunity to augment the data produced by on road systems with data from global positioning systems (GPS) and other sensors. Attention should be paid to the representativeness and meaningfulness (or not) of such data and there is still merit in actually speaking to people who use local travel networks to inform cycle plans.

### Metrics and indices

The abundance of data on transport systems, including from new sources outlined above, is worthless if it cannot be usefully employed. Work must be done to analyse, aggregate and communicate the valuable information collected (the important modelling step is outlined in the next section). Indices and metrics present an opportunity to further condense the vast amount of data now available to transport planners into something understandable and actionable.

Key performance indicators about the transport system, such as average vehicle speed on the network, have long been used to guide decision making for motorised modes. Frequent reporting of such indices help to embed the outcomes they represent into the core objects of the planning process. Historically there has been a lack of similarly simple indices for non-motorised modes. However, recent research has led to the development of new cycle and walking specific indices, many of which are generalisable to new contexts where sufficient data is available. A handful of these are outlined in this section, in increasing order of sophistication.

Probably the simplest metric of transport system performance with respect to cycling is the **proportion of trips** cycled. These 'modal split' estimates are widely reported at national, regional and local levels. Being unit-less coefficients, they are not influenced by the scale of the transport system they represent. Mode split can be used to compare cycling levels locally with the national average: in Cambridgeshire, for example, around 10% of the population cycled to work in 2011 whereas in West Yorkshire barely 1% did. By comparing such simple metrics with the national average of 3%, policy makers can check how well they are doing overall and, potentially, establish ways in which they could 'do better'.

Another simple metric of cycling provision is the total distance of cycle paths. The total length of Dutch cycle paths increased from 9,000 km to 29,000 km between the 1970s and the 2010s, illustrating the long-term embedding of cycling as a central mode of transport in the country. Similarly, London's cycle path network has grown substantially since the turn of the 21^st^ century, measuring 683 km in 2010 and with further plans for expansion [@deegan_cycling_2015]. By dividing the total distance of the network by meaningful denominators such as the number of people served, or the total cost of the project, further value can be extracted from this otherwise simplistic measure. In inner London, for example, new cycling infrastructure built between 2002 and 2010 cost an average of £346 per metre, compared with £283 per metre in outer London [@deegan_cycling_2015]. To allow network length to be compared between different contexts, distance per person can be used: dividing previously mentioned figures on cycle network distance by the total population results in network indices of 
<!-- 29000000 / (16800000) -->
<!-- 683000 / (8500000) -->
1.7 and 0.08 metres of cycle paths per capita
in London and the Netherlands respectively. By this measure, the Netherlands
has proportionally 20 times more cycle network than London.

A long cycle network does not necessarily mean a high-quality or well-connected cycle network. In addition to the cost per metre of new cycleways, there are a number of measures on network quality. As with cycling metrics overall, there is a hierarchy of cycle infrastructure quality metrics, ranging from the simple and crude to complex and sophisticated. Cycle path width is an important example of the former. The UK's recommended (but not mandatory) width of 2.0m and a minimum suggested width of 1.5m in the [Design Manual for Roads and Bridges](http://www.standardsforhighways.co.uk/dmrb/vol5/section2/ta9105.pdf) is an example of how consideration for cycling can be embedded into high level planning documents through recommended values for simple metrics about the travel network.

More sophisticated metrics combine a range of quantitative measures into a single street or network level value. The Cycling Level of Service (CLoS) metric, for example, provides a way to combine a range of indicators into a single number for each piece of infrastructure evaluated. Focussed on the six design outcomes of safety, directness, coherence, comfort, attractiveness and adaptability, the CLoS has 35 sub-metrics, which are intended to be evaluated by transport planners to identify how best to improve any particular segment on the travel network [@transport_for_london_london_2015].

Beyond simple aggregate and segment-specific metrics, @buehler_bikeway_2016 recommend a shift towards network level metrics for cycling provision. Progress in this direction has been made by @schoner_missing_2014, who provided a wide range of quantitative metrics on cycle network characteristics, including on the directness of cycling infrastructure, connectivity and network density.

To test the utility of these network level indices, @schoner_missing_2014 tested their ability to explain observed variability in cycling rates across 74 cities in the USA. The results were impressive: network indices based on secondary data could explain half of the variability in cycling levels. These results suggest that network-wide indices on cycle networks offer great potential to embed cycling considerations in strategic transport plans.

## Modelling

Transport modelling was developed largely in response to the policy question of how to accommodate for future increases in car use [@boyce_forecasting_2015]. Due largely to this historical context, cycling has "generally been ignored in ... traffic management modelling and scheme implementation" [@deegan_planning_2011]. However, with the increased interest in cycling over the past few years, there have been efforts to better account for cycling in transport models. This provides a powerful opportunity for embedding cycling more firmly in transport planning. Models can have a large impact on real world outcomes, as the decision making process is heavily reliant on model results [@hollander_who_2015]. Making models that are better suited to the needs of cycling infrastructure and policy design therefore represents a major opportunity for embedding the mode at one of the earliest stages in the transport planning process. Before outlining these opportunities, it's worth mentioning four specific problems with current transport models. 

First, many transport models simply do not represent cycling as a distinct mode. There are models that group cycling and walking together into a single mode, greatly reducing their ability to generate realistic results for either mode. This is partly because cycles are difficult to represent on the road network: they are not constrained by the same rules that define where cars can and cannot go. (Cycles can be carried up stairs for example, something that is impossible for cars.)

Second, many transport models are black boxes. This is not just a problem for cycling: it prevents the transparent and democratic assessment of all options because it prevents the interested citizen or informed academic or politician from reproducing the results. Now that open source software projects are widespread and increasingly used in industry, there is a strong argument to make all publicly funded transport models open source.

Third, many transport models are built on questionable assumptions yet purport to be objective. The UK's National Transport Model (NTM), for example, presents a narrow range of scenarios, all of which assume that car dependency will continue and is heavily reliant on the (often unstated) assumption that car use will continue to be closely coupled with economic growth [@chatterjee_planning_2006]. The NTM also has two additional problems with established transport models: it does not represent cycling as a separate mode and it is not open source (making it impossible for interested citizens to check the results).

To help tackle some of these issues with the lack of national modelling capability for cycling, the DfT commissioned the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) @lovelace_propensity_2016. The PCT provides evidence on the level of cycling potential at multiple levels: areas, desire lines, routes and the route network. An interactive map and multiple scenarios allow the user to explore the geographical distribution of cycling potential in their local area. This at present only works in the UK context, but which has the potential to scale internationally, and represents an opportunity to embed cycling within national transport models.

The PCT provides an example of the opportunities for embedding cycling into transport planning via innovations in transport modelling and visualisation. It is completely open source and can be used by the public using an internet browser, demonstrating that new technology can substantially reduce barriers to access transport planning tools. Accessible tools like the PCT offer transport planners, politicians and campaigners the same evidence base, encouraging more informed debate. Furthermore, by deliberately  cycling growth to be embedded in the consciousness of these stakeholders, encouraging informed (rather than ideologically driven) debate.

## Implementation

After funding has been allocated and a plan for spending it has been approved (hopefully by taking opportunities outlined in each of the above stages), the designs will be implemented in reality. @melia_urban_2015 used the term 'filtered permeability' to refer to small interventions that can make cycling more attractive than driving in urban areas.

<!-- Transport contractors who are commissioned to undertake interventions for active transport are generally not walking and cycling specialists. This creates the risk that they will not understand how engineering plans should be translated into physical infrastructure -->

## Monitoring and evaluation

## Public engagement

There are many ways to involve the public at every stage of the transport planning process, and this can help embed the views of people who cycle. In the problem formulation stage, allowing people to input on the kind of future people want can be a powerful form of public engagement. 'Visioning' exercises with local stakeholders can help practitioners and the public find shared long-term aims [@tight_visions_2011].

Transport planning has traditionally been seen as an objective realm, where numbers speak louder than words [@willson_assessing_2001]. Yet there are many opportunities for public engagement in the data collection and analysis phase of transport planning [@deegan_planning_2011]. The authors developed a systematic approach for incorporating local knowledge into cycle network plans, to assist practitioners deal with the complexity of options available. Although modelling tools have advanced since the method was implemented (as described in the next section), there is no doubt that allowing space for community input can greatly enhance the design of pro-cycling interventions. During the project, over 200 studies were conducted resulting in more than 2000 specific recommendations.

Undertaken between 2005 and 2007, before the term Big Data became widely used, @deegan_planning_2011 represents a form of crowd-sourced data, from informed residents of the local area. Additional advantages of this 'stakeholder led' approach include the engagement and 'buy-in' of the local community into new schemes before they are constructed, and the assurance that planners will visit the site in question, cycling. Incorporating human factors into the data collection process, as demonstrated in practice by @deegan_planning_2011, thus represents a major opportunity for embedding cycling at an early stage in the planning process.

# Conclusion

This paper set out to identify opportunities to make cycling more central within transport planning, with a focus on cycling. In the process, it has identified many structural barriers preventing active modes from being taken seriously in transport planning institutions which originate in the origins of the field. This insight, that many of the factors contributing to the marginalisation of cycling are structural and 'systemic' in nature [@beddoe_overcoming_2009], has implications for practitioners and academics hoping to make sustainable modes more central to real world transport plans and policies. Technical fixes and a barrage of evidence about the social benefits of cycling are unlikely to be sufficient to ensure that it receives the attention it deserves.

Having identified these structural issues, which affect all stages of the transport planning process, from data collection to public engagement, the next question was how to tackle them. It was this process of identifying the barriers that led to the concept of 'embedding' in the title of this paper. To 'embed' means to "[implant] so that it becomes ingrained within a particular context" according to the [English Oxford Dictionary](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/embed). A key conclusion of this paper is therefore that cycling must become mainstream concerns within transport planning institutions to avoid cycling projects being seen as 'side projects', to be 'bolted on' to interventions favouring motorised modes.
