# Abstract {-}

The humble bicycle, alongside its family-friendly siblings such the tricycle, tandem and cargo bike, is an effective means of transport for millions of people worldwide. Recent studies suggest that this most efficient of modes has the potential to transform urban transport systems worldwide, to make them healthier, cleaner and more socially equitable. Building on this evidence, political attention and funding has been allocated towards increasing the proportion of trips that are cycled in an increasing number cities and countries. However, cycling is still marginalised from the mainstream discipline and practice of transport planning, preventing it from being taken seriously in the majority of transport planning institutions. This paper explores this issue, with the aim of identifying opportunities for embedding cycling in the discipline and practice of transport planning. A brief review of the history helps understand this marginalisation and suggests organisational restructuring could be an effective way to ensure that active travel receives the attention and resources it deserves. Recent developments create less politically disruptive opportunities for embedding walking and cycling in transport planning, including innovative 'soft infrastructure' products, open source digital tools, and new technologies for monitoring and evaluation. Taking these opportunities at every stage of the transport planning process will help make active travel central to the discipline and practice of transport planning.

The marginalisation of walking and cycling in transport planning has led to work seeking to tackle this imbalance, between the importance of the modes for a sustainable future and the amount of attention they receive. One of the most cogent and widely cited papers in this area is @pucher_making_2008, who use evidence from three countries where a high (10% or more) proportion of trips are made by cycling to illustrate the kinds of policies that make cycling 'irresistable', with a focus on policies in these nations rather than the transport planning *process* which is emphasised in the present paper. Beyond cycling being acknowledged as an important mode in central government (a factor over which most planners have limited control), @pucher_making_2008 found that subtle factors (beyond simply building segregregated cycle paths everywhere) played an important role in making cycling an attractive option. These include investment in and management of cycle parking facilities; good integration with public transport; cycle training for all children and extensive training of car drivers; *strict liability* (a legal device which uses a hierarchy of assumed responsibility whereby the larger and more dangerous vehicle is assumed to be responsible for road traffic casualties until proven otherwise); and a range of measures to discourage car dependency in urban areas.


Recognising that mode choice is personal decision, and sometimes underestimating the role that structural factors linked to car-orientated planning play, there is also a substantial body of research into the social and psychological factors preventing people from walking and cycling. @pooley_policies_2013, for example, found that the widespread perception of cycling as a dangerous and unnusual mode of transport discouraged its wider uptake in the English towns of Leeds, Leicester, Worcester and Lancaster. The policy recommendations that flow from this evidence coincide with those of @pucher_making_2008 and include: a safe physical environment; legistlating for motorists' consideration for active modes; and land use policies to encourage more local economic activity [@pooley_policies_2013]. The logical next question is '*how* to acheive those aims?'. Before tackling this question, from the perspective of transport planning, it is important to understand the reasons for the marginalisation of active modes in the discipline.

# The marginalisation of cycling in transport policy

In their *tour de force* of the history of transport modelling, @boyce_forecasting_2015 demonstrate that the field emerged in a very specific, and one could say unusual, context: the explosive growth of suburbia and car dependency in the USA. Despite the fact that the transport needs of society, perceived and real, have progressed substantially beyond the accomodation of endless growth in car use, this historical legacy still exerts an enormous influence over transport models and the practice of transport planning. Although the question it is clear that the intentions of these early modellers were admirable, it is clear that the outcomes --- a predict and provide paradigm leading to decades of grid-lock, pollution and road traffic casualties --- were sub-optimal. It is revealing to note that cycling is barely mentioned in @boyce_forecasting_2015. If history is written by the winners, the car is undoubtedly the winning mode of transport in the history of transport planning.

# The beginnings of a new transport paradigm?

@banister_sustainable_2008 suggested that the current transport planning paradigm was not conducive to delivering sustainable policies. To remedy this situation a series of reforms were suggested...

# Opportunities for embedding active travel at every stage in the planning process

Transport planning is not a linear process. It is iterative. The insights gleaned from plans that have been implemented should feed back into subsequent plans in a cyclicle process [@ortuzar_modelling_2001]. The transport planning cycle does have an order, however, as illustrated in figure \@ref(fig:stages). These five stages build on the 8 stages described by @ortuzar_modelling_2001, with the four stages they use use to describe modelling (contruction, generation, forecasting and testing) merged into one, and with the addition of public engagement. This addition reflects the shift to more participatory methods in transport planning @banister_sustainable_2008. These stages are useful for thinking about how opportunities to embed active travel travel in transport planning exist at every stage in the process. Note that public engagement is discussed last not because it is the final stage (there is no final stage as the process is cyclicle) but because it relates to all the other stages.

It should be noted that the structure of this section was also influenced by @gallagher_planning_2014, who provide guidlines on planning for cycling. The report begins with the observation that cycling was a major mode of transport in the UK but has been 'neglected' by practitioners since the proliferation of cars in the 1950s and progresses to outline opportunities for embedding cycling in the following areas of transport planning practice: the regulatory context in which transport planning operates; strategic transport plans; the design of new transport networks and routes and the promotion of behavioural change. These suggestions are freely accessible to practitioners and the public, thanks to the Chartered Institution of Highways & Transportation, who commissioned the report and upladed the it on their website [ciht.org.uk](http://www.ciht.org.uk/en/media-centre/news/index.cfm/ciht-launches-new-planning-for-cycling-guidelines).

The guidelines in @gallagher_planning_2014 are not repeated here. Instead, the section extends and generalises their recommendations that relate to the wider planning process, rather than those related to cycling interventions only.

Transport planning and the transport sector overall has traditionally been seen as an objective realm, where numbers speak louder than words. However, there are many ways to take human factors into account in transport planning, as described by @deegan_planning_2011.

@melia_urban_2015 used the term 'filtered permeability' to refer to small interventions that can make cycling more attractive than driving in urban areas.
