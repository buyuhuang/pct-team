# Abstract {-}

Cycling is an effective means of transport for millions of people and has great potential to be much more extensively used in most countries. Despite strategies to promote cycling, funding has generally remained limited and planning for cycling remains a marginal activity for most transport planning authorities. An historical review of transport planning is presented which explores the marginalisation on cycling. In order to properly formulate the transport planning problem which includes cycling as a solution, we argue that structural change is required within transport planning authorities. We also argue that enhanced data collection for cycling as a mode is required. A set of well formulated objectives which are measurable with available data may then be used in open source modelling, which provides a powerful tool for objective decision making. We conclude that these developments will help cycling become central to the discipline of transport planning.

It is widely accepted that transport systems in the majority of settlements across the world are not conducive to environmental sustainability or human health. Much has been written about this problem [e.g. @rouse_energy:_1975;@peake_transport_1994;@han_assessment_2008;@de_nazelle_improving_2011]. Many grand remedies have been proposed [e.g. @wang_strategic_2013;@raux_transport_2010;@cuenot_prospect_2012], but such high-level recommendations have seldom been implemented in practice.

Perhaps part of the reason that the recommendations emanating from research findings are not implemented by policy-makers is that they tend to be abstract and seemingly directed towards world leaders. Yet professionals, such as transport planners, influence decisions at the local level and are often the people most instrumental in shaping local visions, programmes and projects. Furthermore, the remedies suggested in the in the papers referenced above risk being seen as too general and conceptual to be easily translated into practice.

Much has been written about how to make transport systems overall more sustainable, and the topic has become a prominent concern in the transport literature [@schwanen_scientific_2011;@banister_sustainable_2008]. Still, such broad academic advocacy has been slow to filter into real-world transport plans. This paper is deliberately more directed and is centred on cycling. Concentrating attention in this way allows more realistic and actionable guidance for transport planners and academics actively engaging with the planning process.

<!-- This approach is designed to complement, rather than replace, the strategic  and conceptual advice contained in other papers. Transport planning is a practical discipline, so the paper deliberately focusses on factors over which transport planners and engineers have some control. It does not, for example, deal explicitly with the state of the economy or national political priorities, which undoubtedly affect mode choice, but over which planners have little control. -->

<!-- The premise of this paper is the perceived disconnect between the discipline of transport planning and transport policies.

But why focus on cycling? In the transport planning literature there has been much written about sustainability but less focus on cycling (and also walking), despite strong evidence on the ability of this mode to deliver both health and environmental benefits *simultaneously*, and at low cost. This unique mix of 'co-benefits' from cycling is something that 'technological fixes' do not provide, and technological fixes are harder to justify in an age of austerity and hard-pressed resources. Electric cars, for example, are in fact coal-fired cars when driven in the majority of countries where this most polluting of energy sources has yet to be phased out [@van_vliet_energy_2011]. Further, electric cars cannot deliver the health benefits of cycling. Bus rapid transit schemes, to provide another example, can encourage walking [@lemoine_transmilenio_2016] but can be costly [@wirasinghe_bus_2013].

There has been much written about encouraging cycling but little focussed explicitly on the mode's interaction with the process of transport planning. @pucher_making_2008 use evidence from The
Netherlands, Denmark and Germany to illustrate the kinds of policies that make cycling 'irresistible'. Central government buy-in was found to be important, and this was in addition to more subtle factors such as: investment in and management of cycle parking facilities; good integration with public transport; cycle training for all children and extensive training of car drivers; *strict liability* (a legal device which uses a hierarchy of assumed responsibility whereby the larger and more dangerous vehicle is assumed to be responsible for road traffic casualties unless proven otherwise); and a range of measures to discourage car dependency in urban areas.

Cycling uptake has been much studied from psychological and sociological perspecives. @pooley_policies_2013, for example, found that the widespread perception of cycling as a dangerous and unusual mode of transport discouraged its wider uptake in several English towns. The resulting recommendations coincided coincided with those of @pucher_making_2008 and include: a safe physical environment; legislating for motorists' consideration for active modes; and land use policies to encourage more local economic activity [@pooley_policies_2013].
@geus_psychosocial_2008, to take another example, explored a range of factors affecting cycling uptake. Supporting @pooley_policies_2013, the study suggested that a combination of high-quality infrastructure and a supportive social and policy framework was effective in encouraging the uptake of cycling. Of relevance to transport planners, @geus_psychosocial_2008 found that proximity to parks and other green spaces was associated with more cycling, suggesting that directing cycle paths through parks and off busy roads could make cycling more attractive, particularly for people for whom perceived danger and self-esteem is a barrier. This hypothesis has been supported by a natural experiment of an off-road cycle path [@heinen_changes_2015].

@buehler_bikeway_2016 categorised cycle infrastructure interventions by scale, focussing on *links* (e.g. cycle paths), *nodes* (e.g. road junctions) and entire cycle *networks*. Their review strongly suggests taht infrastructure can boost cycling levels. However, evidence on the relative importance of different types of intervention, particularly in relation to node, network and non-infrastructural interventions, was limited. From a planning perspective, @buehler_bikeway_2016 recommend that practitioners should seek to provide for cycling by planning and implementing facilities at the scale of the network rather than individual links and nodes. This accords with the view that a transport system can only be effective when it is a coherent network @gallagher_planning_2014. 

Section 2 discusses the marginalisation of cycling in transport planning in more detail. Section 3 goes on to outline ways of embedding planning for cycling more fully in the local transport planning process including a discussion of appropriate institutional structures, the need for data, and importantly the way the data is used in transport models. We draw conclusions in Section 4.

<!-- It can be seen therefore that there are reasons linked to co-benefits to focus on cycling as a key part of a wider sustainable transport strategy. While there is some growing recognition of a need to plan better for cycling, little work has focused on how planning for cycling should be thoroughly embedded in the transport planning process. Evidence from mode choice studies suggests that a range of barriers block cycling uptake in many contexts. These barriers operate at many levels, from national transport priorities down to personal self-esteem. These can, in turn, be influenced by transport infrastructure. The framing of cycle planning in terms of the creation of seamless networks is required in order maximise the chances of creating the most optimal system. This is a different approach than homing in on single interventions to solve particular problems (e.g. provision of cycle paths or advertising the benefits of cycling). -->

<!-- The logical next question is: how can transport planning practitioners and transport engineers achieve seamless networks for cycle traffic? At a more pragmatic level, the question may be re-framed as how can the prioritised elimination of the most damaging barriers to cycling in local and regional transport plans be achieved? -->
<!-- The rest of this paper examines and provides these questions. -->

# The marginalisation of cycling in transport planning

Transport modelling is an important part of transport planning. In their comprehensive history of transport modelling, @boyce_forecasting_2015 demonstrate that the field emerged in a very specific context: the explosive growth of suburbia and car dependency in the USA. Although the policy objectives of transport planning have progressed substantially beyond the accommodation of growth in car use, this historical legacy still exerts an enormous influence over the field. Transport modelling, which plays an important role in deciding how funding is allocated, was never designed for cycling, and this issue persists today.

There is little doubt that the intentions of the early modellers were admirable and that it was an exciting time: "urban travel forecasting was definitely 'where the action was' for young transportation engineers and planners entering the field in the 1960s" [@boyce_forecasting_2015, p. 67]. In hindsight, however, it seems the resulting models facilitated a 'predict (demand) and provide (infrastructure)' paradigm leading to car dependency and associated negative externalities: pollution, road traffic casualties and transport inequality. Would it have been impossible for early models to create alternative future scenarios where cycling, and active travel more generally, played a central role in transport plans? @boyce_forecasting_2015 do not discuss this, although it is clear that warnings from dissenting voices in academic research were not heeded. @fels_comparative_1975, for example, envisioned future transport "policy evaluations related to energy utilization", in which cycling was prioritised over driving, as the former was found to be far more efficient than the latter, consuming 0.1 kWh/mile rather than 1 or more kWh/mile. 

During the conditions of economic growth and increased car economic ownership, which prevailed for several decades following the Second World War, facilitating expansion of motor traffic was the primary objective in most transport planning institutions. The policy reasons for this prioritisation of the motor car  were simple: the car was a symbol of modernity, wealth and economic growth. Active modes were viewed as outdated, suitable for the poor and eccentric while the rest of society shifted to the luxury of cars. In this context cycling was not merely marginalised from transport planning: it was almost completely absent.

An interesting example of the historical marginalisation of cycling in mainstream transport planning comes from the 1970s USA, which coincided with oil price shocks and societal questions around energy use [e.g. @illich_energy_1974]. It is instructive that the only major study on cycling during this period conducted by the US government was not from the Department of Transport, but the Environmental Protection Agency [@dougherty_bicycle_1974]. This 72 page report, Bicycle Transportation, was motivated by the "unprecedented boom" in bicycle sales during the early 1970s and goes on to outline, in great detail, the social, health and environment benefits of the mode. The report also comments on the marginalisation of the mode from mainstream planning, noting that "Government has general viewed the bicycle as a recreational vehicle" [@dougherty_bicycle_1974, p. 2].

<!-- When the oil price stabilised growth in car use accelerated again in the USA and this trend was followed in most nations across the world. Despite noting the economic benefits for cycling infrastructure, with segregated cycle paths costing roughly 50 times less per metre than highways ($20,000 vs $1 million per mile), @dougherty_bicycle_1974 were unsuccessful in persuading the US Government to invest heavily in cycling.  -->

Instead, transport planners focussed on the car. Cycling was generally seen as a form of recreation rather than transport and, as such, did not deserve dedicated space on the travel network. Cycle infrastructure, in the few places where there was any at all, tended to be placed in ad-hoc places to minimise costs. In the minority of plans where cycling was accounted for, the acronym SLOAP (space left over after planning) encapsulates the approach adopted for cycle planning. This approach has prevailed in most places in most countries ever since.

As @pucher_making_2008 point out, there were a few exceptions to this rule. In the Netherlands in particular, there was a concerted effort during the 1970s to ensure that cycling *was* promoted as a legitimate, efficient, effective and beneficial  mode of transport. The history of provision for cycling in the Netherlands shows, however, that it emerged from an overtly political movement, in opposition to the dominance of the motor car, and not from the results of any level of consideration within transport planning.

<!-- It is interesting to note that, far from always being a cycling paradise, the Netherlands experienced dramatic *declines* in cycling during the 1960s and 1970s, following the motorisation of urban transport in other cities. Cycle use roughly halved between 1960 and 1980, falling from around 1400 km to around 700 km per person per year. This shows that even in the Netherlands, cycling was becoming marginalised by the motor car and it took vociferous public campaigns to change the tide: "Outrage at the scale of road deaths, especially of children, the oil crisis of 1973, and a general sense that enough had been conceded to the motor car, were factors bringing about a change in public attitudes" [@wardlaw_history_2014]. Central government funding followed, allowing the total distance of cycle paths in the Netherlands to increase from around 9,000 km to 16,000 km between the late 1970s (when the reinvestment in cycling began) and 1988.  -->

One could argue that even in the Netherlands, cycling is still marginalised by the car. Despite high levels of cycling, the Netherlands is a car dependent country and the distance travelled by car each year by far outweighs the number of passenger kilometres of travel taking place by bicycle. Even on high-quality Dutch infrastructure conflict arises, e.g. between cycle and moped users [@boztas_dutch_2015]. Furthermore, partly as a consequence of the quality and extent of cycle networks in the Netherlands, cycling on the roads is uncommon and often not permitted. Therefore, despite impressive investments in and uptake of cycling in the Netherlands, the country still has a long way to go before active modes predominate.

@banister_sustainable_2008 discussed transport paradigms in detail and suggested that the current transport planning paradigm was not conducive to delivering sustainable policies. To remedy this situation a series of reforms were suggested. These were primarily conceptual and high-level in character but include some actionable guidance for transport planners, including the importance of public engagement in the planning process, and the need to build adaptability into transport planning, which has historically been a top-down process. We pick up the following section on the issue of the top down process by reference to our understanding of a need for structural change within planning authorities, and the opportunities offered by open-source modelling for greater public engagement. 

# Opportunities for embedding cycling in the planning process

Transport planning is iterative. The insights gleaned from plans that have been implemented feed back into subsequent plans in a cyclical process [@ortuzar_modelling_2001]. The transport planning cycle does have an order, however, as illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:stages). The six stages build on the eight stages described by @ortuzar_modelling_2001, with the four stages they use to describe modelling (construction, generation, forecasting and testing) merged into one stage, and with the addition of public engagement, which reflects the shift to more participatory methods [@banister_sustainable_2008].

```{r stages, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Stages of the transport planning process."}
knitr::include_graphics(c("../figures/stages.png"))
```
The remainder of this section discusses the three key stages at which lead to the implementation of schemes, that is to say: the formulation of the problem, data collection and analysis and modelling. We make the point that modelling, which has historically been the preserve of specialists, has the potential through open-source approaches to be democratised and form a part of public engagement.

## Formulation of the problem: the need for structural change

@gallagher_planning_2014 outline opportunities for embedding cycling in the following areas of transport planning practice: the regulatory context in which transport planning operates; strategic transport plans; the design of new transport networks and routes and the promotion of behavioural change
(see [ciht.org.uk](http://www.ciht.org.uk/en/media-centre/news/index.cfm/ciht-launches-new-planning-for-cycling-guidelines) for an open access version of the report). We extend and generalises their recommendations to the wider planning process.

Transport planning does not take place in a vacuum. It takes place within a dynamic and often politicised institutional context. This is tacitly acknowledged by @ortuzar_modelling_2001, who regard it as part of the "formulation of the problem" at the beginning of their eight stages. But how does the formulation occur? 
@ciht_guidelines_1996 suggests that this stage requires politicians, planners and stakeholders to state a vision for an area, and define the urban and the transport objectives that need to be achieved. This statement will then feed into initial ideas and concepts for the development of transport solutions. 
The 'framing' of the problem is thus strongly influenced by institutional structures and decision making processes and should be considered at the outset of cycling plans.

A common problem faced by planners designing for active modes is that transport planning institutions were generally set-up at a time when 'transport planning' was virtually synonymous with 'highway planning'. As outlined in the previous section, cycling and walking were barely considered to be legitimate transport modes. Although this is changing, the structure of transport planning organisations has generally not also changed, as government institutions are subject to a high degree of inertia. Figure \@ref(fig:organo) illustrates the point, with a case study of the UK's Department for Transport (DfT). The DfT staff member responsible for cycling is the 'Deputy Director Sustainable Travel and Equalities'. It is interesting to note that their brief also includes oversight of the multi-modal Local Sustainable Transport Fund (LSTF) and its successors, disabilities and equalities agendas, hence the lack of the words 'walking' or 'cycling' in their job description. Despite the breadth of this brief, the 'organogram' depicted in Figure \@ref(fig:organo) shows that the post is a long way down the DfT's managerial hierarchy and the post-holder reports to three other people (the Director of Local Transport, Director General: Roads Traffic and Local, and Director General, Roads, Local and Traffic). Contrasting the lack of mention of 'walk' or 'cycle' against the car-orientated term 'roads' (which is mentioned five times in Figure \@ref(fig:organo) and at every level of the DfT's structure) demonstrates the extent to which motorised modes are embedded in the DfT's institutional structure. This suggests that a pre-cursor to any serious consideration of cycling is an organisational restructuring to embed this mode in such a way that their beneficial efficiency and effectiveness is given due weight. 

```{r organo, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="The organisational structure of the UK's Department for Transport. See http://reference.data.gov.uk/gov-structure/organogram/ for further information."}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/dft-organo-web.png")
```

The UK's DfT provides a clear example of opportunities for embedding cycling in transport planning via institutional restructuring, but the issue is by no means limited to the national level in the UK. The same issues can be found at the local authority level across the UK, where the highway and traffic engineering functions of local and regional councils tend to be more prominent in institutional hierarchies, and receive more funding, than functions responsible for cycling. Moreover, the same problem is international. None of the eleven Directors of the US Department of Transport, for example, are responsible for cycling. On the other hand security, crisis management and business feature prominently (see
[www.transportation.gov](https://www.transportation.gov/mission/administrations/intelligence-security-emergency-response/operations-division)).
Similarly, motorised transport infrastructure such as highways and high-speed rail feature prominently in China's Ministry of Transport, while cycling (and walking) is absent from the ministry's website (see [www.mot.gov.cn/](http://www.mot.gov.cn/)). Even the Dutch Directorate for Mobility and Transport (which sits within the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment) has a structure that is biased towards high energy transport: four of its six sub-directorate job titles explicitly mention motorised modes (Roads and Safety, Public Transportation and Rail, Maritime Affairs and Civil Aviation) and none is tasked with further embedding cycling (see [www.government.nl/ministries/](https://www.government.nl/ministries/ministry-of-infrastructure-and-the-environment/documents/leaflets/2015/01/21/organisation-structure-ministry-of-infrastructure-and-the-environment)).

Although they are close to the root of the problem, institutional structures generally take many years to change [@beddoe_overcoming_2009].  It therefore makes sense to find ways for cycling to be taken more seriously within existing structures. An example of this, also taken from the UK context, is Highways England, a government-owned company with responsibility for managing the core road network. Despite its remit being predominantly related to motor traffic "improve England’s motorways and major A roads", it has recently adopted a Cycling Strategy which is publicly available from its [website](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/490545/S150572_Cycling_Strategy.pdf).

This strategy for the English strategic road network identifies areas of overlap between roads investment and maintenance, and cycling, and aims to highlight the potential of Highways England to "provide integrated schemes which improve cycling facilities." Given that the budget of Highways England far exceeds that allocated for cycling specifically, this cycling strategy relating to the core road network presents an opportunity for embedding cycling within transport planning thinking even within an organisation whose structure and focus is dominated by provision for motor traffic. Given that most countries now have agencies, in one form or another, that operate at various levels of aggregation for planning and managing substantial parts of the road network, this approach to embedding cycling could potentially scale internationally.

Unfortunately, the restructuring of institutional hierarchies is outside the scope of most transport planners can achieve, but clarity of purpose of transport plans should not be lacking. However, transport plans have historically started with the (frequently unstated) objective of enabling the growth in car use, without increasing congestion [@boyce_forecasting_2015]. This formulation of the goal seems to have continued into the present day, with 'path dependency' ensuring that provision will inevitably lead to more demand for future provision, to the detriment of walking and cycling [@hensley_healthy_2014].

## Data collection and analysis

Inputs into the planning process include data on demand for travel, the distribution of that demand between origins and destinations, and the choices of mode and route. Transport models typically focus on the time and cost of a journey. Cycling has hardly featured in travel demand modelling partly because of lack of focus on cycling in planning, and partly because modelling has not been sufficiently sophisticated to capture the subtleties of the journey experience and hence mode and route choice characteristic linked with cycling. These subtleties include measures for the comfort and attractiveness of a route from a cycling perspective. The problem, therefore could be seen as one of identifying the relevant features for cycling and to quantify them in a such a way that they can be modelled. The other way of thinking about the problem is to suggest that the design of networks for cycle traffic is not just a 'technical' problem, but a multi-dimensional problem that includes wider urban design issues which are not able to be prescribed in models or design terms.

We measure what we value, and the lack of data and knowledge about cycling demonstrates further that it is marginalised in most transport contexts: the majority of automated transport data collection devices installed around the world measure motorised traffic. The scale of this problem, and practical solutions to it, have been described from a US perspective by @lindsey_minnesota_2013.

<!-- "[Transport authorities] have established sophisticated, comprehensive monitoring systems to produce estimates of vehicular traffic on federal, state, and local roads. However, comparable systems for monitoring non-motorized traffic --- -->
<!-- bicyclists and pedestrians --- -->
<!-- have not been established, and transportation planners and engineers generally lack basic information about bicycle and pedestrian traffic volumes needed to plan for these modes." -->

The lack of quantitative data is a barrier preventing transport planners from assessing the value and contribution of cycling. Conversely, the benefits of measuring cycling behaviour range from the technical to the political. From a technical point of view, detailed information about the contexts in which people *do not* cycle can provide evidence about what local barriers are, allowing planners to target their interventions more effectively. In policy terms, cycling helps prevent the marginalisation of the mode within the transport planning organisation: technical staff will be needed to analyse the resulting data and this will help ensure that the mode is treated with appropriate diligence. Further, data on cycling behaviour can be used to raise the profile of cycling in the public consciousness. As an example of this, the Copenhagen Bicycle Account, the forerunner of this profiling of cycling in the public consciousness, is being rolled out by others as a policy tool, for example by seven UK cities [e.g. @sustrans_bike_2015].

There are many ways to measure cycling use. The most basic measure is manual or automatic count at a point on a link or through a junction. As detailed by @lindsey_minnesota_2013, such count data can help allocate resources to and assess the effectiveness of interventions aiming to increase the number of walking and cycling trips. The main methods for counting cyclists are manual field counts, infra-red monitors, induction loop detectors, piezometric and pneumatic movement sensors and video imaging.

Link counts may also be used to estimate cycle kilometres, but this requires relatively comprehensive counts across a variety of link types and assumptions about similarities of links which are not counted, as well as knowledge about link length. Owing to the generally lower level of a bicycle count relative to a motor traffic count the confidence interval of such estimates will be relatively wide. Beyond cycle kilometrage estimates, we are also interested in patterns of movement across a network, and these would require origin and destination surveys created by cordons and screenlines within a network and some form of identification on the bicycle. The alternative, less direct method would be a sample survey based on household interviews.

Transport-specific surveys will usually ask about transport choices for a range of journey purposes and perhaps more detailed questions about cycling (e.g. 'what are the main barriers preventing you from cycling?'). If constructed in appropriate ways, such surveys may provide an indication of the parameters relevant for mode and route choice modelling. Usually, however, specific stated preference and revealed preference data will be required to parametise mode and route choice models.

Increasingly, there are 'Big Data' sources such as GPS data provided by smartphone 'apps' and origin-destination matrices derived from mobile telephones connecting to cellphone towers that are being used for transport modelling purposes. With the rapid uptake of personal activity monitoring by athletes and enthusiasts, new datasets provide a potentially low-cost opportunity to augment the data produced by on-road systems with data from global positioning systems (GPS) and other sensors. Attention should be paid to the representativeness and meaningfulness (or not) of such data and there is still merit in actually speaking to people who use local travel networks to inform cycle plans.

There is a wide range of options for measuring cyclists volume and patterns of movement and more of this sort of data needs to be collected to help to embed cycling at the heart of the transport planning process. 

Indicators for the transport system, such as average vehicle speed on the network, are used to guide decision making for motorised modes. Frequent reporting of such indices. Often labelled as ‘Key Performance Indicators’, helps to embed the phenomena they represent in the core objectives of the planning process. Historically there has been a lack of similar indices for non-motorised modes. However, recent research has led to the development of new cycling- and walking-specific indices, many of which can be generalised to new contexts where sufficient data is available.

Probably the simplest metric with respect to active travel is the **proportion of trips** that are made using these modes. These 'modal split' estimates are widely reported at national, regional and local levels. Being unit-less coefficients, they are not influenced by the scale of the transport system they represent. Mode split can be used to compare cycling levels locally with the national average: in Cambridgeshire, for example, around 10% of the population cycled to work in 2011 whereas in West Yorkshire approximately 1% did. By comparing such simple metrics with the national average of 3%, policy makers can understand relative positions and, potentially, establish ways in which they could develop.

A further relevant metric is the length of the cycle network. The length of Dutch cycle paths increased from 9,000 km to 29,000 km between the 1970s and the 2010s, illustrating the long-term embedding of cycling as a central mode of transport in the country. Similarly, London's cycle network has grown substantially since the turn of the 21^st^ century, measuring 683 km in 2010 and with further plans for expansion [@deegan_cycling_2015].Further value can be extracted from this otherwise simple measure of transport ‘supply’, by dividing the network length by meaningful denominators such as the number of people served. On this basis, The Netherland has 1.7 metres of cycle paths per capita and London had 0.08, suggesting that the Netherlands has 20 times greater supply of cycle network than London.
<!-- 29000000 / (16800000) -->
<!-- 683000 / (8500000) -->

<!-- A long cycle network does not necessarily mean a high-quality or well-connected cycle network. In addition to the cost per metre of new cycleways, there are a number of measures on network quality. As with cycling metrics overall, there is a hierarchy of cycle infrastructure quality metrics, ranging from the simple and crude to complex and sophisticated. Cycle path width is an important example of the former. The UK's recommended (but not mandatory) width of 2.0m and a minimum suggested width of 1.5m in the [Design Manual for Roads and Bridges](http://www.standardsforhighways.co.uk/dmrb/vol5/section2/ta9105.pdf) is an example of how consideration for cycling can be embedded into high level planning documents through recommended values for simple metrics about the travel network. -->

The quality and connectedness of a network are also important. Quality might be crudely estimated from cost per metre, width or more sophisticated measures such as the Cycling Level of Service (CLoS) metric used in London which rates six attributes as follows: safety, directness, coherence, comfort, attractiveness and adaptability [@transport_for_london_london_2015].

Beyond aggregate and segment-specific metrics, @buehler_bikeway_2016 recommend a shift towards network-level metrics for cycling provision. Progress in this direction has been made by @schoner_missing_2014, who provided a wide range of quantitative metrics on cycle network characteristics, including on the directness of cycling infrastructure, connectivity and network density.
<!-- (reported in units of km/km^2^).  -->
To test the utility of these network-level indices, @schoner_missing_2014 tested their ability to explain observed variability in cycling rates across 74 cities in the USA. The results were impressive: network indices based on secondary data could explain half of the variability in cycling levels. These results suggest that network-wide indices on cycle networks offer great potential to embed cycling considerations in strategic transport plans.

## Modelling

Transport modelling was developed largely in response to the policy question of how to accommodate for future increases in car use [@boyce_forecasting_2015]. Due largely to this historical context, cycling has "generally been ignored in ... traffic management modelling and scheme implementation" [@deegan_planning_2011]. However, with the increased interest in cycling over the past few years, there have been efforts to better account for cycling in transport models. This provides a powerful opportunity for embedding cycling more firmly in transport planning. Models can have a large impact on real world outcomes, as the decision making process is heavily reliant on model results [@hollander_who_2015]. Making models that are better suited to the needs of cycling infrastructure and policy design therefore represents a major opportunity for embedding the mode at one of the earliest stages in the transport planning process. Before outlining these opportunities, it's worth mentioning four specific problems with current transport models. 

First, many transport models simply do not represent cycling as a distinct mode. There are models that group cycling and walking together into a single mode, greatly reducing their ability to generate realistic results for either mode. This is partly because cycles are difficult to represent on the road network: they are not constrained by the same rules that define where cars can and cannot go. (Cycles can be carried up stairs for example, something that is impossible for cars.)

Second, many transport models are black boxes. This is not just a problem for cycling: it prevents the transparent and democratic assessment of all options because it prevents the interested citizen or informed academic or politician from reproducing the results. Now that open source software projects are widespread and increasingly used in industry, there is a strong argument to make all publicly funded transport models open source.

Third, many transport models are built on questionable assumptions yet purport to be objective. The UK's National Transport Model (NTM), for example, presents a narrow range of scenarios, all of which assume that car dependency will continue and is heavily reliant on the (often unstated) assumption that car use will continue to be closely coupled with economic growth [@chatterjee_planning_2006]. The NTM also has two additional problems with established transport models: it does not represent cycling as a separate mode and it is not open source (making it impossible for interested citizens to check the results).

To help tackle some of these issues with the lack of national modelling capability for cycling, the DfT commissioned the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) @lovelace_propensity_2016. The PCT provides evidence on the level of cycling potential at multiple levels: areas, desire lines, routes and the route network. An interactive map and multiple scenarios allow the user to explore the geographical distribution of cycling potential in their local area. This at present only works in the UK context, but which has the potential to scale internationally, and represents an opportunity to embed cycling within national transport models.

The PCT provides an example of the opportunities for embedding cycling into transport planning via innovations in transport modelling and visualisation. It is completely open source and can be used by the public using an internet browser, demonstrating that new technology can substantially reduce barriers to access transport planning tools. Accessible tools like the PCT offer transport planners, politicians and campaigners the same evidence base, encouraging more informed debate. Furthermore, by deliberately  cycling growth to be embedded in the consciousness of these stakeholders, encouraging informed (rather than ideologically driven) debate.

## Implementation

After funding has been allocated and a plan for spending it has been approved (hopefully by taking opportunities outlined in each of the above stages), the designs will be implemented in reality. @melia_urban_2015 used the term 'filtered permeability' to refer to small interventions that can make cycling more attractive than driving in urban areas.

## Monitoring and evaluation

## Public engagement

There are many ways to involve the public at every stage of the transport planning process, and this can help embed the views of people who cycle. In the problem formulation stage, allowing people to input on the kind of future people want can be a powerful form of public engagement. 'Visioning' exercises with local stakeholders can help practitioners and the public find shared long-term aims [@tight_visions_2011].

Transport planning has traditionally been seen as an objective realm, where numbers speak louder than words [@willson_assessing_2001]. Yet there are many opportunities for public engagement in the data collection and analysis phase of transport planning [@deegan_planning_2011]. The authors developed a systematic approach for incorporating local knowledge into cycle network plans, to assist practitioners deal with the complexity of options available. Although modelling tools have advanced since the method was implemented (as described in the next section), there is no doubt that allowing space for community input can greatly enhance the design of pro-cycling interventions. During the project, over 200 studies were conducted resulting in more than 2000 specific recommendations.

Undertaken between 2005 and 2007, before the term Big Data became widely used, @deegan_planning_2011 represents a form of crowd-sourced data, from informed residents of the local area. Additional advantages of this 'stakeholder led' approach include the engagement and 'buy-in' of the local community into new schemes before they are constructed, and the assurance that planners will visit the site in question, cycling. Incorporating human factors into the data collection process, as demonstrated in practice by @deegan_planning_2011, thus represents a major opportunity for embedding cycling at an early stage in the planning process.

# Conclusion

This paper set out to identify opportunities to make cycling more central within transport planning, with a focus on cycling. In the process, it has identified many structural barriers preventing active modes from being taken seriously in transport planning institutions which originate in the origins of the field. This insight, that many of the factors contributing to the marginalisation of cycling are structural and 'systemic' in nature [@beddoe_overcoming_2009], has implications for practitioners and academics hoping to make sustainable modes more central to real world transport plans and policies. Technical fixes and a barrage of evidence about the social benefits of cycling are unlikely to be sufficient to ensure that it receives the attention it deserves.

Having identified these structural issues, which affect all stages of the transport planning process, from data collection to public engagement, the next question was how to tackle them. It was this process of identifying the barriers that led to the concept of 'embedding' in the title of this paper. To 'embed' means to "[implant] so that it becomes ingrained within a particular context" according to the [English Oxford Dictionary](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/embed). A key conclusion of this paper is therefore that cycling must become mainstream concerns within transport planning institutions to avoid cycling projects being seen as 'side projects', to be 'bolted on' to interventions favouring motorised modes.
