## Introduction

The Lewes-Uckfield trainline is a proposed project to restore a rail link between Uckfield and Lewes. This is part of wider plans to increase rail capacity in the area. As stated in the project brief, "Such infrastructure has the potential to support cycling if high quality infrastructure is built alongside." This appendix analyses cycling potential along the proposed route, which is 16 km in length (see Figure \@ref(fig:lc)).

# Current travel patterns

There are `r nrow(cents_lc)` MSOAs whose population weighted centroids lie within a 10 km buffer of the line, representing `r sum(cents_lc$all)` commuters. This area is illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:lc).

```{r lc, fig.cap="Overview of the Lewes-Uckfiled line"}
# osm_tiles = read_osm(bb(z_lc, 1.05))
# saveRDS(osm_tiles, "data-sources/osm_tiles_ukfield.Rds")
osm_tiles = readRDS("data-sources/osm_tiles_ukfield.Rds")
qtm(osm_tiles) +
  tm_shape(buff) + tm_borders(col = "blue", lwd = 3) +
  tm_shape(l_lc) + tm_lines(lwd = "all", scale = 20, col = "Percent cycling", alpha = 0.5, n = 5, breaks = 2^(-1:4),
                              palette = "Spectral", auto.palette.mapping = F, ) +
  tm_shape(lewes_uckfield) + tm_lines(lwd = 5, col = "black") 
# knitr::include_graphics("figures/lewes-uckfield-overview.png")
```

The total number of single-stage commutes that pass through the buffer is higher: `r sum(l_lc$all)` commuters. As Figure \@ref(fig:lc) illustrates, many of these commuters would not interact with the rail line, as they are focused on commutes between Brighton and surrounding settlements in the far southeast of the 20 km buffer. Only a few hundred commutes pass directly parallel to the route, mostly due to 10 to 20 km (route distance) commutes between MSOAs in Lewes, Ringmer and Uckfield. This implies that cycle paths running parallel to the rail line itself have quite low commuter cycling potential. The next section analyses this potential in more detail.

# Cycling potential around the proposed route



Under the ambitious Ebike scenario, the PCT shows that cycling potential along routes running parallel to the line is uneven geographically. Unsurprisingly, cycling potential is clustered at either end of the proposed route, with relatively high increases modelled along segments of the network between Lewes and Ringmer (an increase from 35 to 336 commuters is modelled along a section of the B2192 running west from Lewes) and routes running north-south through Uckfield. This is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:pct-uck).
