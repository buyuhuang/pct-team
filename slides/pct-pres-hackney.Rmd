# Cycling in context

## The global context | Source: [WHO](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/Creating-maps-in-R/blob/master/R/worldmap-road-casualties.R)

<!-- - Transport does not take place in a vacuum -->
<!-- Important when thinking about transport to consider global context  -->
<!-- Particularly as transport is the reason we live in a globalised world -->
<!-- And more and more the transport problems in different countries are the same -->
<!-- This is a map of the rate of road traffic casualties worldwide -->
<!-- 8th most common cause of loss to DALYs -> 4th by 2030!! -->
<!-- Best evidence suggests that the biggest problem of all, though, is climate change -->
<!-- The latest evidence on that one is scary, we have a moral obligation to act -->

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/global-energy-sector.png")

## Transport energy use by mode | Source: [worldenergy.org](https://www.worldenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/wec_transport_scenarios_2050.pdf)

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}

> - But over 2/3^rds^ of oil production!

## The impact of cycling in context dependent | Source: [Fishman et al. (2014)](http://eprints.qut.edu.au/67026/1/Does_bike_share_reduce_car_use_E_Fishman.pdf)

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
df = data_frame(
  City = c("Melbourne", "Brisbane", "Washington, D.C.", "Minnesota", "London"),
  `Bike trips/per day` = c(0.6, 0.3, 3.0, 0.9, 3.1),
  `Replacement ratio` = round(100 / c(19, 21, 7, 19, 2), 1),
  `Reduction in car use per bike` = c(193, 79, 247, 135, 79)
)
knitr::kable(df)
```

> - The impacts of cycling policy depend on context and policies

<!-- It's often hard to see where the humble bicycle fits into these grand plans -->

## The importance of the 'replacement ratio'

- The replacement ratio is "the number of additional bicycle trips required to replace or prevent a single car trip" [@lovelace_assessing_2011]:

$$
RR = \frac{\Delta Trips_{Cycled}}{-\Delta Trips_{Driven}}
$$

# Transport planning

<!-- - Transport planning isn't a 'pure' academic discipline -->
<!-- - It arose out of a specific context -->

## Institutionalised priorities

Note: TfL's front page has a chairlift going through the centre!

<!-- Out of 11 'policies', not a single one mentions walking or cycling -->
<!--     Aviation and airports -->
<!--     HS2: high speed rail -->
<!--     Rail network -->
<!--     Road network and traffic -->
<!--     Road safety -->

# Embedding active modes in transport planning

## My current cycle path in the UK is currently...

<iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tpbd7bottio?t=22" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Why?

- Experimental: shows willingness to try things out

- Cost effective: only £5 per metre

- Clearly linked with other travel modes: 'stick and carrot'

- Appeals to all types of cyclists and fits all types of pedal cycles

## A definition of Propensity to Cycle and its uses

> Propensity to cycle refers to the modelled
uptake of cycling at area, desire line and
route network levels under different
scenarios of the future. Policy relevant
scenarios include meeting national or local
targets, the potential uptake if people in the
study area cycled as much as the Dutch do
or the impact of electric bikes on people's
willingness to cycle longer distances. ([see Get Britain Cycling article](http://getbritaincycling.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Get-Britain-Cycling_2016.pdf), 2016)

The tool aims to help prioritise **where** interventions are most needed based on where cyclable trips are most common
