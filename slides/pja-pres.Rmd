## Locally targetted vs national interventions

- Nationally uniform transport policies have several advantages
    - Avoid 'mixed messages'
    - In some cases essential (e.g. fuel prices)
    - We're all in it together

- BUT, locally specific transport policies can boost cost-effectiveness
    - Should walking/cycle paths be the same width throughout?
    - Point facilities will be used more if they're located sensibly (e.g. bus stops)
    - Cycle share schemes much more effective when spatial configuration matches urban form
    
## Transport planning needs have a history | Forecasting urban travel

```{r}
include_graphics("http://www.e-elgar.com/shop/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/225x/040ec09b1e35df139433887a97daa66f/9/7/9781848449602_4_1.jpg")

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}

```

## The origins of modelling

> - "urban travel forecasting was definitely 'where the action was' for young transportation engineers and planners entering the field in the 1960s" [@boyce_forecasting_2015, p. 67].

> - heavily restricted by computing power

> - no consideration of walking or cycling

## Open source software for transport planning {.smaller}

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
f = "~/repos/foss4t/ossTransportToolsList.csv"
if(file.exists(f)) {
  d = readr::read_csv(f)
  d = d[1:3]
  d = d[!grepl(pattern = "GEOS|GD", x = d$`Softare product`),]
  knitr::kable(d)
}
```

## A broad classification, and use cases

- General purpose products that have found many transport applications

> - Python
> - R
> - QGIS

- Dedicated transport programs

> - MATSim
> - SUMO

- Add-on packages that providing transport planning capabilities to existing (mature) programs

> - stplanr
> - AequilibraE
> - activitysim

## The wider movement

- Open data
- Publicly accessible
- The wider community

## Open source in other sectors

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height="85%"}
include_graphics("http://thewindowsclub.thewindowsclubco.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/How-to-Make-Money-Using-Open-Source-Software.png")
```

> - We can learn from 'early adopter' sectors

## Community buy-in

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
include_graphics("../figures/discussion.png")
```

## Incorporation of new (open source?) digital technologies

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("http://images.cdn.stuff.tv/sites/stuff.tv/files/styles/big-image/public/news/see-sense-light.jpg")
```

## Hot off the press: the cycle to schools layer | See our [test server](http://npct0.vs.mythic-beasts.com/schools/)

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/pct-schools-image.png")
```

## Headline result: huge potential to optimise network for children and adults

```{r}

```

## How this can integrate with LCWIP?

- Timing uncertainties
- Funding uncertainties

## The future landscape of the PCT

- Roll-out of the schools layer
- More scenarios (prototype 'near market' available)
- Properly training local authorities
- Making the methods multi-modal?
- Multi-purpose?
- Who will do the work?
- How do we keep it open source and well (better) documented?
- Internationalisation

# The techy bit

## Origin-destination data

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages("stplanr")
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(stplanr)
data("flow")
nrow(flow)
flow[1:3, 1:3]
```

## Spatial data

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
data("cents")
cents@data[1:2,]
desire_lines = od2line(flow = flow, zones = cents)
plot(desire_lines)
points(cents)
```
