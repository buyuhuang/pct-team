Mounting evidence about the damage caused by car-dominated transport systems to human and environmental health have led many to ask: is another transport system possible?
Ultimately, as with other sectors of the economy, only a full transition away from fossil fuels will constitute a 'sustainable' transport system: **an effective zero carbon transport system is possible**.

To arrive at a zero carbon transport system it is clear that there must be more cycling, the most efficient form of personal travel.
This talk focusses on this small part of the decarbonisation challenge, which requires political will, planning and evidence.
It is this final ingredient that this talk will focus on, building on the speaker's experience researching transport and energy use [@lovelace_assessing_2011; @lovelace_energy:_2008; @lovelace_energy_2014] and leading the development of the national Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) [@lovelace_propensity_2017] and the **stplanr** R package for processing transport data[@lovelace_stplanr:_2017].

## What is the Propensity to Cycle Tool? 

- Context (see the government's ['CWIS' report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cycling-and-walking-investment-strategy))
- 2 years in the making, the PCT is now part of the legally binding Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Strategy (CWIS)
- Mentioned in the forword of this legally binding document
- Being used by dozens of local authorities to design strategic cycling networks
