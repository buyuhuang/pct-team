<!-- Transport models have an enormous influence on transport plans, with major impacts on the attractiveness of active travel. Yet these models were developed in a different era, when the aims of transport policy were very different from what they are today. This paper provides a brief review of what transport models are, demystifying the methods and software underlying their operation. The review finds that transport models provide useful and relatively objective information to public and private sector researchers but that their public utility is hindered by proprietary licenses, inaccessibility to the public and emphasis on unsustainable modes. Overall it seems that transport models are not fit for solving 21^st^ Century issues: they reduce the 'option space' visible to policy makers and perpetuate the 1950s view of a car dominated future, rather than illustrating what is possible. Opportunities for the future are demonstrated with reference to a new breed of open source, citizen contributed and publicly accessible transport planning tools. Rather than start from scratch, the paper explores how methods and concepts from traditional transport models, such as 'predict and provide' can be repurposed for active travel planning. The paper concludes with insight into how the transport planning tools of the 20^th^ Century can be upgraded, and in some cases replaced, so they can tackle the challenges of the 21^st^.  -->

<!-- ## A few comments about the word 'radical' -->

<!-- - Derived from the Latin work *radix*, meaning 'root' (source: [Oxford Dictionary](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/radical))  -->

<!-- > - Implies solving the *cause* of the problem rather than its symptoms -->

<!-- > - What's at the root of the 'transport problem'? -->

<!-- > - Of course it defines how to define problem:  -->
<!--    > - Inequality? -->
<!--    > - Economics? -->
<!--    > - Health? -->
<!--    > - Sustainability? -->
<!--    > - Climate change? -->

<!-- ## Premises -->

<!-- > - We live in a car dominated system -->
<!-- > - Transport models are leverage points in the transport system -->
<!-- largely responsible for embedding and perpetuating this domination -->
<!-- > - 'Systemic' change is a long process and involves institutional change [@beddoe_overcoming_2009] -->
<!-- > - Leverage points such as models can speed-up the transition -->
<!-- > - Software for transport models is more accessible than ever -->

## The origins of modelling

> - "urban travel forecasting was definitely 'where the action was' for young transportation engineers and planners entering the field in the 1960s" [@boyce_forecasting_2015, p. 67].

> - heavily restricted by computing power

> - no consideration of walking or cycling

# Proprietary software vs sustainability

## Transport planning tools: expensive...

<!-- - Transport models are close to the root of the problem -->
<!-- - They were not developed to solve current transport problems -->
<!-- - Open source software has flourished in other sectors -->
<!-- - Open source software offers many benefits for transport planners, including: -->
<!--     - Encourages community particupation -->
<!--     - Reduces costs -->
<!--     - Increases collaboration -->

# Discussion

## The case for open source software in transport planning

Practical reasons

> - It's cheaper
> - Faster evolving
> - More robust: more eyes on it

Philosophical reasons

> - Transport Planning is intertwined with democracy and power relations
> - People will try to manipulate it for own benefits - transparency/reproducibility = key
> - Control of public sector organisations over their data and analysis capabilities
> - Hypothesis: Use open source -> greater good

## Common objections to open source software

> - It's not user friendly
> - It's not where jobs are (now)
> - It doesn't have the support of trusted suppliers
> - Anyone can come and 'hack' your code!
> - Developer's don't get paid
> - Any more?

## Open source software has no warranty...

## What to keep, what to replace?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
difftable = read.csv(text = 
"Keep, Replace, How
Terminology, Inaccessible, Online tools
Equations, Proprietary ownership, Open source licences
Use of scenarios, Ageing software, New software
, Narrow scenarios of future, Flexible models
, Black boxes, Simple and open method"
  )
knitr::kable(difftable)
```

## Overlaps between energy and software transition

- Both require 'systemic' change [@beddoe_overcoming_2009]
- They seem like technical problems on the outset but are highly political
- It takes time, commitment and persuasion
- The benefits take time to realise

Could there be a mutually reinforcing feedback loop:

Shift in (digital) infrastructure -> change in behaviour and priorities?

## Points of contention

Most people agree that:

> - Transport models are not working optimally
> - Open source software is 'good'
> - It would be good to save money and switch

Areas of disagreement:

> - How to get there
> - Whether it's a slow transition or 'cold turkey'
> - Who should write the code
> - Any volunteers (or funders)?

<!-- ## Get tooled up | How to get involved? -->
