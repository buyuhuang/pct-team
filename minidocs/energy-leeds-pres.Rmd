## Talk structure

1) Some comments on the transport system

2) Software for modelling a zero carbon system

3) Case study of the PCT

> - But first some context
> - Then let's talk solutions

# Context

## Premises

- The transport system is not working well for anyone

> - To 'fix' it, policy interventions are needed

- Policy interventions can be more effective when locally targetted

> - However, there are infinite potential interventions at the local level
> - Evidence is needed to prioritise among the infinity of options 

- Only a systematic and objective evidence base will do

> - And that means data + statistics! 🔢

> - And that means computing 🖥️

> - And that means human-computer interaction 👨👩💻

- And that means software is vital for sustainable transport policy

## What's wrong with the transport system? | "Works fine for me"

## Some transport statistics

- Transport eats time. We spend on average 6% of our lives (sleeping/resting: 37%; commuting: 1%; paid work:  25%)   [@king_worktime_2017].

- Transport eats space. More than half many US cities spaces are occupied by parking (~20%) and streets (~40%). In Texas, for example, 21.3% of land space was taken by surface parking (Source: [oldurbanist.blogspot.co.uk](http://oldurbanist.blogspot.co.uk/2011/12/we-are-25-looking-at-street-area.html))

- Transport eats energy. In 2015 it accounted for **39.9%** of final energy consumption ([DECC](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/579542/ET_Dec_16.pdf)).

## Energy use in transport (UK)

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/transport-40pc-energy.png")
```

## Energy use in Transport nationally

> Final  energy  consumption  (excluding  non-energy  use)  was  1.9  per  cent  higher  than  in  
2014 [0.3% seasonally adjusted],  with  rises  in  the  domestic,  transport  and  services  sectors  but  with  a  fall  in  the  industrial sector. The  rise  in  consumption  was  due  to  increased  
transport demand likely due to lower petroleum prices.

## Solutions - policy

- Incentivise low carbon, healthy travel

> - Build cycle paths (where they are most needed, of appropriate design)
> - Embed walking and cycling - urban realm improvements, facilities sign-posting
> - Subsidise car sharing solutions

- Disincentivise high carbon solutions

- Creative approaches
> - Reducing worktime hours: "The three best performing scenarios were those that involved
employees working a four-day week as they enabled companies to reduce
energy use, and employees to reduce commuting" [@king_worktime_2017]. 

## The overlay between travel to school and work layers

- Setup:

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
library(sp)
# load data
rf_schools = readRDS("~/npct/pctSchoolsUK/pctSchoolsApp/data/west-yorkshire/rnet.Rds")
rf_commute = readRDS("~/npct/pct-data/west-yorkshire/rnet.Rds")

# create bounding box polygon
bbox_poly = stplanr::bb2poly(rf_schools)
proj4string(bbox_poly) = proj4string(rf_commute)

# spatial subset
rf_commute = rf_commute[bbox_poly,]
```

## Origin-destination data

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages("stplanr")
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(stplanr)
data("flow")
nrow(flow)
flow[1:3, 1:3]
```

## Spatial data

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
data("cents")
cents@data[1:2,]
desire_lines = od2line(flow = flow, zones = cents)
plot(desire_lines)
points(cents)
```

## Visualisation code | Results: see [rpubs.com/RobinLovelace/](http://rpubs.com/RobinLovelace/244545)

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(tmap)
tmap_mode("view")
m = tm_shape(rf_schools) +
  tm_lines(lwd = "dutch_slc", scale = 20, col = "darkgreen") +
  tm_shape(rf_commute) +
  tm_lines(lwd = "dutch_slc", scale = 20, col = "darkblue")
```
