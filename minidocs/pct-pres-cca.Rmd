## A definition of Propensity to Cycle and its uses

> Propensity to cycle refers to the modelled
uptake of cycling at area, desire line and
route network levels under different
scenarios of the future. Policy relevant
scenarios include meeting national or local
targets, the potential uptake if people in the
study area cycled as much as the Dutch do
or the impact of electric bikes on people's
willingness to cycle longer distances. ([see Get Britain Cycling article](http://getbritaincycling.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Get-Britain-Cycling_2016.pdf), 2016)

The tool aims to help prioritise **where** interventions are most needed based on where cyclable trips are most common

## The PCT team

- James Woodcock (Principal Investigator, Cambridge University)
- Anna Goodman (Lead Data Analyst, LSHTM)
- Rachel Aldred (Implementation Lead, Westminster University)
- Robin Lovelace (Lead Developer, University of Leeds)
- Ali Abbas (User Interface, University of Cambridge)
- Alvaro Ullrich (Data Management, University of Cambridge)
- Nikolai Berkoff (System Architecture, Independent Developer)

## How it works

See @lovelace_propensity_2015 for details

![](../figures/coventry-centroids-4pres.png)

## How it works II | It depends on trip distances

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%', fig.cap="Modal share of trips made by cycling for English commutes in West Yorkshire (left) and Oxfordshire (right) currently and under 4 scenarios of change.", fig.show='hold'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("../figures/dd-west-yorks.png", "../figures/dd-ox.png"))
```


## Route allocation

## Route network analysis

## Timeline

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/milestones.png")
```

- See [github.com/npct/pct-shiny/milestones](https://github.com/npct/pct-shiny/milestones) to track the PCT's development

## Phase I (Feb - July 2015)

-  Build and test a prototype model
-  Identify 'desire lines' of greatest potential
-  Make the tool scalable nationally
-  Create a website that will make the Propensity to Cycle Tool a publicly accessible resource

## Phase II (January 2016 - March 2017)

**Version 1 - nationwide (V1 launch: June 2016)**

-  ~Route-allocated hilliness, network layer~
-  ~Include health outcomes (HEAT)~
-  ~National-level results~
-  V1.5 - smaller (LSOA) zones (Jan 2017)
-  Training

**Version 2 - local deployment**

-  Include non-commute trips
-  Compatibility with Local Authority trip demand models
-  Micro-level analysis (V 2.2)

## Bonus extras

<div class="columns-2">

- CO~2~ savings
- Route Network layer

# Uses of the PCT

## Currently

> - Strategic network planning
> - Public engagement
> - 'Visioning' 
> - Estimating health and carbon benefits of uptake
> - Overlay demand for cycling with supply of safe infrastructure, e.g. to inform Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plans (LCWIP) (credit: Adrian Lord)
> - Providing ready made mappable data (via data download)

## With further work

> - Creating local builds and informing local targets and 
> - Modelling impacts of new developments
> - Crowd-sourced transport planning (e.g. by integrating data from 'citizens as sensors' and Cycling Environment Assessment Tool)
> - A global PCT?

## Another example use: are 'fast' routes 'quiet'?

Which cities are these? What's the difference?

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("../figures/rf-lei.png", "../figures/fq-cam.png"))
```

## What about validation? 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/pct-vs-strava-for-leeds.png")
```

## In summary...

> - The PCT provides an evidence base about **where** to intervene
> - Freely available for all to use
> - Open source and transparent
> - Complements local knowledge, tools and data
> - Should help get people on same page

## The propensity to cycle in Leicester

Local 'build' for the local authority

## Thanks for listening!

- Thanks to the institutions behind the PCT team: Universities of Cambridge, Leeds and Westminster.

- The PCT was delivered in partnership with Brook Lyndhurst (Phase I) and Atkins (Phase II).

- Thanks to CycleStreets.net and everyone who has contributed

- Thanks to the Department for Transport for funding and especially to Shane Snow for commissioning the tool, and for support and feedback.

- See `@robinlovelace` for updates from me!
