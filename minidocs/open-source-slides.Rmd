## Structure of the talk

> - The origins of transport modelling

> - Comments on transport models and transport modelling

> - An open source approach

## A few comments about the word 'radical'

- Derived from the Latin work *radix*, meaning 'root' (source: [Oxford Dictionary](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/radical)) 

> - Implies solving the *cause* of the problem rather than its symptoms

> - What's at the root of the 'transport problem'?

> - Of course it defines how to define problem: 
   > - Inequality?
   > - Economics?
   > - Health?
   > - Sustainability?
   > - Climate change?

## The origins of modelling

> - "urban travel forecasting was definitely 'where the action was' for young transportation engineers and planners entering the field in the 1960s" [@boyce_forecasting_2015, p. 67].

> - heavily restricted by computing power

> - no consideration of walking or cycling

# What's wrong with transport models

## Transport planning tools: expensive...

```{r, echo=FALSE}
grid.raster(readPNG("../figures/software-costs.png"))
```

## And potentially dangerous!

## Summary

- Transport problems are multi-faceted so 'techno-fixes' are not enough
- Transport models are close to the root of the problem
- They were not developed to solve current transport problems
- Open source software has flourished in other sectors
- Open source software offers many benefits for transport planners, including:
    - Encourages community particupation
    - Reduces costs
    - Increases collaboration
    
> - How do we get there?
