## Talk structure

1) Open source tools in statistics/transport

2) Computing needs of transport planners

3) Case studies (stplanr + PCT)

> - But first some context
> - Then let's talk solutions

# Context

## Premises

- The transport system is not working well for anyone

> - To 'fix' it, policy interventions are needed

- Policy interventions can be more effective when locally targetted

> - However, there are infinite potential interventions at the local level
> - Evidence is needed to prioritise among the infinity of options 

- Only a systematic and objective evidence base will do

> - And that means data + statistics! 🔢

> - And that means computing 🖥️

> - And that means human-computer interaction 👨👩💻

- And that means software is vital for sustainable transport policy

## Some transport statistics

- Transport eats time. We spend on average 6% of our lives (sleeping/resting: 37%; commuting: 1%; paid work:  25%)   [@king_worktime_2017].

- Transport eats space. More than half many US cities spaces are occupied by parking (~20%) and streets (~40%). In Texas, for example, 21.3% of land space was taken by surface parking (Source: [oldurbanist.blogspot.co.uk](http://oldurbanist.blogspot.co.uk/2011/12/we-are-25-looking-at-street-area.html))

- Transport eats energy. In 2015 it accounted for **39.9%** of final energy consumption ([DECC](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/579542/ET_Dec_16.pdf)).

## Energy use in transport (UK)

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/transport-40pc-energy.png")
```



## Energy use in Transport nationally

> Final  energy  consumption  (excluding  non-energy  use)  was  1.9  per  cent  higher  than  in  
2014 [0.3% seasonally adjusted],  with  rises  in  the  domestic,  transport  and  services  sectors  but  with  a  fall  in  the  industrial sector. The  rise  in  consumption  was  due  to  increased  
transport demand likely due to lower petroleum prices.

## The origins of modelling

> - "urban travel forecasting was definitely 'where the action was' for young transportation engineers and planners entering the field in the 1960s" [@boyce_forecasting_2015, p. 67].

> - heavily restricted by computing power

> - no consideration of walking or cycling

<!-- ## Summary -->

<!-- - Transport problems are multi-faceted so 'techno-fixes' are not enough -->
<!-- - Transport models are close to the root of the problem -->
<!-- - They were not developed to solve current transport problems -->
<!-- - Open source software has flourished in other sectors -->
<!-- - Open source software offers many benefits for transport planners, including: -->
<!--     - Encourages community particupation -->
<!--     - Reduces costs -->
<!--     - Increases collaboration -->

<!-- > - How do we get there? -->

# Discussion

## The case for open source software in transport planning

Practical reasons

> - It's cheaper
> - Faster evolving
> - More robust: more eyes on it

Philosophical reasons

> - Transport Planning is intertwined with democracy and power relations
> - People will try to manipulate it for own benefits - transparency/reproducibility = key
> - Control of public sector organisations over their data and analysis capabilities
> - Hypothesis: Use open source -> greater good

## Common objections to open source software

> - It's not user friendly
> - It's not where jobs are (now)
> - It doesn't have the support of trusted suppliers
> - Anyone can come and 'hack' your code!
> - Developer's don't get paid
> - Any more?

## Open source software has no warranty...

## What to keep, what to replace?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
difftable = read.csv(text = 
"Keep, Replace, How
Terminology, Inaccessible, Online tools
Equations, Proprietary ownership, Open source licences
Use of scenarios, Ageing software, New software
, Narrow scenarios of future, Flexible models
, Black boxes, Simple and open method"
  )
knitr::kable(difftable)
```

## Overlaps between energy and software transition

- Both require 'systemic' change [@beddoe_overcoming_2009]
- They seem like technical problems on the outset but are highly political
- It takes time, commitment and persuasion
- The benefits take time to realise

Could there be a mutually reinforcing feedback loop:

Shift in (digital) infrastructure -> change in behaviour and priorities?

# Solutions

## We're (accidentally) doing something right in terms of coal | Source: [DECC](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/579542/ET_Dec_16.pdf). Risk: electric cars.

## Points of contention

Most people agree that:

> - Transport models are not working optimally
> - Open source software is 'good'
> - It would be good to save money and switch

Areas of disagreement:

> - How to get there
> - Whether it's a slow transition or 'cold turkey'
> - Who should write the code
> - Any volunteers (or funders)?

<!-- ## Get tooled up | How to get involved? -->

<!-- > - You ARE involved! -->
<!-- > - Try a range of tools -->

## Solutions - policy

- Reducing worktime hours: "The three best performing scenarios were those that involved
employees working a four-day week as they enabled companies to reduce
energy use, and employees to reduce commuting" [@king_worktime_2017]. 

- Incentivise low carbon solutions
