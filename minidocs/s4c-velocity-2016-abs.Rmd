**Organizer: Robin Lovelace.**
Robin is the Lead Developer of the Propensity to Cycle Tool, an open source, online
system for cycle-orientated planning. He will bring a technical perspective to the
debate, with a focus on the practicalities of how to create open source software
underlying online tools.

**Chair: John Parkin**
John has a long career as a transport planner and cycling researcher. He has
pioneered methods for assessing cycling potential and has written influential
guidance on cycling, and will bring transport engineering expertise to the table.
Panel participants:

**Randy Rzewnicki.**
Randy works for the European Cycling Federation and has years of experience of
seeing the implementation of national cycling plans. Randy will bring an
international perspective to the talks and insight into how the tools can be used in
practice.

**Ricardo Marques.**
Ricardo is an experienced cycling advocate and academic, with an engineering
background. As such, he will help bridge the gap between academic research and
cycling advocacy. Ricardo will help answer the question: how can such tools be used
by local campaign groups?

**James Woodcock**
James lead a programme on Public Health Modelling at the Centre for Diet and Activity Research (CEDAR), University of Cambridge. He is PI on the PCT and has led the development of the Integrated Transport and Health Impact Modelling tool (ITHIM). He has recently received funding for two new projects, TIGTHAT and METAHIT. He is one of the core expert group of the WHO HEAT tool.

**Susan Handy.**
Susan has expertise researching the relationships between transportation and land use. Her input will help explore the how the PCT approach can be used to model shifting travel behaviors, an input into wider strategies for a transition to a post carbon transport system.



## Topic of interest

For investment in cycling infrastructure to be effective, it must be built where it is
needed. A dual direction 1.5 m shared use path is inappropriate along a route that
has the potential to be used by over 5000 cycles per hour at its peak, for example.
Likewise, a dedicated one way cycle path 3 m wide built along a desire line with a
maximum potential of less than 500 cycles per hour at its peak may not represent
the most cost effective expenditure of money and natural resources per unit of
cycling uptake (e.g. measured in $/pkm cycled). This problem has been tackled to
some extent by the Propensity to Cycle Tool (go to www.pct.bike to test it out). The PCT has been created using by an academic team funded by the UK's Department for
Transport (DfT), and has received praise from transport planning professionals,
academics, and industry alike. But what is the potential for the method and
interactive toolkit to scale internationally? How can the tool be improved? It is the
purpose of this Panel Session to discuss the opportunities, barriers and ways
forward to allow the PCT to be deployed in other countries. As indicated in the
session title, it would ultimately be possible for online tools for assessing the
geographical distribution of cycling potential to scale worldwide. After an appraisal
of national experience of tools for assessing cycling potential, is envisioned that
discussion will shift towards how such system, based on open source code, open
data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and 'open government' initiatives and an
international research community, could help provide a toolkit for evidence based
planning for cycling worldwide.

Keywords: cycling potential, modal shift, infrastructure evaluation

## How the panel session will be organised

The panel session will be organized in 2 parts, the first will provide a 5 minute overview of the PCT followed by cooments from panel members and questions from the audience. The latter will be 20 minutes, which will provide time (up to 2 minutes) for panelist statements and then discussion with the audience.

1. What is the Propensity to Cycle Tool and how could it scale globally? This will focus on clarifying what the tool is, how it can be used and its potential to help plan for cycling in settlements and countries worldwide (5 minute presentation by Robin). It will touch on how the PCT differs existing tools such as Bikeprint for strategic cycle planning and its strengths, limitations and future potential. 

Panelists will be invited to comment on how this relates to tools they have used.

2. What is needed? This section will identify is missing from the current suite of tools for strategic cycle planning, and set out a ‘wishlist’ of tool features that participants and attendees most want to see and How to move forward? 

In it we will focus on the follow issues:

- Data opportunities and limitations
- Skill requirements and where to find them
- Funding
- Training
- Public engagement

Each session will be time limited and will provide an opportunity for the audience to input points of information, suggested actions or questions.Outcomes
The expected outcomes from the panel session will be:

- Better understanding among session attendees and, via online dissemination, the international cycling community, of the strengths and weaknesses of existing tools and how they can be used, currently, to improve transport planning from a cycling perspective. (There will be recordings and a write-up for the international cycling community.)

- Clarity about the needs of different places with respect to tools for strategic planning for cycling.

- A roadmap outlining how to proceed to create and improve internationally
scalable open source, online tools for sustainable transport planning.
